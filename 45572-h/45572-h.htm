<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The following receipts, the result of many years
experience, have been placed before the public, in
the hope that they may prove useful to all who
may consult them, and under the conviction that
they will be found truly practical.</p>

<p>The author has endeavored to draw them up in
the most concise and simple manner; and has in
all cases sacrificed <em>style</em> to minute detail; not even
avoiding repetition where it might render the directions
more explicit.</p>

<p>A great defect in many works of a similar character
is, that the cook is forced to wade through a
formidable amount of reading before she can learn
the process of making a pudding, or discover the
different articles necessary to the concocting of a
dish.</p>

<p>Whilst some are so diffuse, others on the opposite
extreme, are so brief in their explanations as
to fall far short of being understood, and consequently
are ever liable to misconception.</p>

<p>As no utensils are requisite except those in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>mon
use in every family, the difficulty of preparing
the various dishes will be greatly lessened.</p>

<p>Great attention has been paid to that department
of cookery exclusively adapted to the sick or convalescent,
most of the dishes having been prepared
according to the directions of eminent physicians
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Nearly all the receipts in this book are purely
American; the author therefore entertains a hope
that they may meet the wants of the community,
and the approbation of all those who may honor
them with a trial.</p>

<p class="ph1"><small>THE</small><br />
NATIONAL COOK BOOK.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="SOUPS" id="SOUPS">SOUPS.</a></h2>


<p>All soups are better to be made with fresh uncooked
meat, as that which has been cooked once
has lost much of its flavor and nearly all its juices.
It is therefore better economy to hash or spice your
cold meat, and buy fresh for soup.</p>

<p>Soup should not boil <em>very</em> hard, as that has a
tendency to toughen the meat.</p>

<p>Fat meat is not so proper nor healthy for soup
as the leaner parts of the finest meat. The fat
does not impart much flavor, and is not palatable.</p>

<p>Soup may be kept till the next day; before it is
heated over again, skim off the cake of fat which
congeals on the top. It is often preferred one day
old to the day it is cooked.</p>


<h3>BEEF SOUP.</h3>

<p>1. Crack the bone of a shin of beef, and put it
on to boil in one quart of water to every pound of
meat, and a large tea spoonful of salt to each quart
of water. Let it boil two hours, and skim it well.
Then add four turnips pared and cut in quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
four onions pared and sliced, two carrots scraped
and cut in slices, one root of celery cut in small
pieces, and one bunch of sweet herbs; which should
be washed and tied with a thread, as they are to be
taken out when the soup is served. When the
vegetables are tender, take out the meat, strain off
the soup and return it to the pot again, thicken it
with a little flour mixed with water; then add some
parsley finely chopped, with more salt and pepper
to the taste, and some dumplings, made of a tea
spoonful of butter to two of flour, moistened with a
little water or milk. Drop these dumplings into
the boiling soup; let them boil five minutes and
serve them with the soup in the tureen. Noodles
may be substituted for the dumplings. For directions
for making them see <a href="#Article_11">No. 11</a>.</p>


<h3>VEAL SOUP.</h3>

<p>2. Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a pot with
four quarts of water, and add a tea spoonful of salt
to each quart. Pare and slice three onions, four
turnips, two carrots, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a
small portion of celery. Let the veal boil one hour,
then add the above vegetables. When they are
tender, strain the soup. Put it in the pot it was
boiled in, thicken the soup with some flour mixed
smoothly with a little water, and add a little parsley
finely chopped. Make some dumplings of a
tea spoonful of butter to two of flour, and milk or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
water enough to make a very soft dough. Drop
them into the boiling soup. They should be about
as large as a hickory-nut, when they are put in.
If noodles are preferred, they may be put in and
boiled ten minutes. For directions for making them
see <a href="#Article_11">No. 11</a>. Dish the meat with the vegetables
around it. Drawn butter may be served with it,
or any other meat sauce.</p>


<h3>PEPPER-POT.</h3>

<p>3. Cut in small pieces four pounds of tripe,
put it on to boil in as much water as will cover it,
allowing a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of
water. Let it boil three hours, then have ready
four calves feet, which have been dressed with the
skin on. Put them into the pot with the tripe
and add as much water as will cover them; also
four onions sliced, and a small bunch of sweet herbs
chopped finely. Half an hour before the pepper-pot
is done add four potatoes cut in pieces; when these
are tender add two ounces of butter rolled in flour,
and season the soup highly with cayenne pepper.
Make some dumplings of flour and butter and a
little water&mdash;drop them into the soup; when the
vegetables are sufficiently soft, serve it.</p>

<p>The calves feet may be served with or without
drawn butter.</p>

<p>Any kind of spice may be added. If allspice or
cloves are used, the grains should be put in whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHICKEN SOUP.</h3>

<p>4. Wash a fine large chicken, put it in a pot and
cover it with water with a little salt. Pick and
wash two table spoonsful of rice, a bunch of sweet
herbs, washed, and tied with a thread, two onions,
and a little celery cut fine. Add these to the chicken
as soon as it begins to boil. When the chicken
is tender add a small bunch of parsley finely minced;
let it boil a few minutes and then serve it. Season
with pepper and salt to the taste. Serve the chicken
with drawn butter. Some like allspice in this
soup. If you should like it add a tea spoonful of
the whole grains.</p>

<p>Noodles or dumplings may be substituted in place
of the rice. To make noodles see <a href="#Article_11">No. 11</a>. The
dumplings are made with a tea spoonful of butter,
two of flour, and water enough to form a soft dough.
Take a tea spoonful of the dough and drop into the
boiling soup. Let them boil a few minutes.</p>

<p>Pearl barley may be used instead of rice.</p>


<h3>LAMB SOUP.</h3>

<p>5. Take a neck and breast of lamb, wash it, and
to each pound of meat add a quart of water, and a
tea spoonful of salt. Pare and slice two onions, two
carrots, four turnips, two or three potatoes and a
bunch of sweet herbs. Add all these to the meat
after it has boiled one hour. If in the proper season
add three or four tomatoes or half a dozen ochras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>When the vegetables are done, take out the meat,
and add some flour mixed to a smooth paste with a
little water. Noodles or dumplings may be added,
as for beef soup. Some thicken lamb soup with a
little rice put in the pot with the lamb.</p>


<h3>OYSTER SOUP.</h3>

<p>6. Take one hundred oysters out of the liquor.
To half of the liquor add an equal quantity of water.
Boil it with one tea spoonful of crushed allspice, a
little mace, some cayenne pepper and salt. Let it
boil twenty minutes, then strain it, put it back in the
stew pan and add the oysters. As soon as it begins
to boil, add a tea cupful of cream, and a little
grated cracker rubbed in one ounce of butter. As
soon as the oysters are plump, serve them.</p>


<h3>CLAM SOUP.</h3>

<p>7. Wash the shells of the clams and put them
in a pot without any water. Cover the pot closely
to keep in the steam; as soon as the clams
are opened which will be in a few minutes, take
them out of the shells and proceed as directed for
oyster soup.</p>


<h3>GREEN CORN SOUP.</h3>

<p>8. Put on a knuckle of veal to boil in three
quarts of water, and three tea spoonsful of salt.
Cut the corn off of one dozen ears, and put it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
on to boil with the veal. When the veal is
tender the soup is done. Then roll an ounce of
butter in flour and add to it before it is served. If
the fire has been very hot and the water has boiled
away too much, a little more may be added.</p>


<h3>PEA SOUP.</h3>

<p>9. This is made in the same manner as the green
corn soup, only the peas must not be put in till
about half an hour before the meat is done. A
quart of peas will be requisite to make a dish of
soup.</p>


<h3>SUCCOTASH.</h3>

<p>10. One quart of green corn cut off the cob,
one quart of lima beans, and two pounds of pickled
pork. If the pork should be very salt, soak it an
hour before it is put on to boil. Put the pork on
to boil and let it be about half cooked before the
vegetables are put in. Then put in the corn (which
must be cut off the cob) and the beans; let them
boil till they are tender. Take all up, put the
meat on a dish and the vegetables in a tureen. It
should be a very thick soup when done.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_11" id="Article_11">TO MAKE NOODLES FOR SOUP.</a></h3>

<p>11. Beat up an egg and to it add as much flour
as will make a very stiff dough. Roll it out in a
thin sheet, flour it, and roll it up closely, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
would do a sheet of paper. Then with a sharp knife
cut it in shavings about like cabbage for slaw; flour
these cuttings to prevent them from adhering to
each other, and add them to your soup whilst it is
boiling. Let them boil ten minutes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="FISH" id="FISH">FISH.</a></h2>


<p>Fish should always be perfectly fresh when
cooked. To select fresh ones observe the eyes; if
they have a bright life-like appearance the fish is
fresh; if, on the contrary, the eyes are sunken and
dark colored, and have lost their brilliancy, they
are certainly stale. Some judge by the redness of
the gills, but they are sometimes colored to deceive
customers.</p>

<p>Crabs should be of a dark green color, and when
fresh from the water are always very lively, the
same remarks hold good with regard to lobsters.
If the tail of the lobster will return to its former
position when pulled out, the lobster is fresh.</p>

<p>Never buy a clam or oyster if the shells are
parted. If the valves are tightly closed the oyster
is fresh.</p>


<h3>BOILED ROCK.</h3>

<p>12. Scale a rock, take out the eyes and gills,
draw it and wash it well. Flour a cloth, wrap the
fish in it, and boil it in plenty of water strongly
salted. A common sized fish requires about half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a large tea cupful of salt. Place your fish kettle
over a strong fire, and when the water boils put in
the fish. Let it boil hard twenty minutes. Take
it out of the cloth carefully, place it on your fish
dish and send it to the table. Have egg sauce in a
sauce boat. Mashed potatoes are an accompaniment
to boiled fish. Garnish the dish with green
parsley.</p>

<p>If any of the boiled fish should be left from dinner
it may be spiced as shad, and makes an excellent
relish for breakfast or tea.</p>


<h3>FRIED ROCK.</h3>

<p>13. Clean and score your fish; wash and wipe
them dry; season well with cayenne pepper and
salt. Let them stand at least one hour before they
are cooked, that the seasoning may have time to
penetrate them. Have ready a pan of hot lard,
dredge flour over your fish, put them in the pan
and fry them slowly, that they may be done through.
They should be of a handsome brown on both sides.</p>

<p>All pan fish are fried in the same way.</p>


<h3>BOILED COD.</h3>

<p>14. Soak a dried cod for three hours in cold
water; scrape and wash it very clean; then put it
on to boil in as much cold water as will cover it.
Let it boil half an hour. Drain it on your fish dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>,
and serve it with mashed potatoes, drawn butter,
or egg sauce, and eggs boiled hard.</p>

<p>The castor should contain cayenne pepper, mustard,
sweet oil, pepper, vinegar, and catsup.</p>


<h3>COD FISH CAKES.</h3>

<p>15. Boil a piece of salt cod; take out all the
bones, and mash with it equal quantities of mashed
potatoes. Season it with pepper and salt to your
taste; then add as much beaten egg as will form
it into a paste. Make it out into thin cakes, flour
them, and fry them of a light brown.</p>


<h3>SPICED SHAD.</h3>

<p>
16. One large shad,<br />
Two table spoonsful of salt,<br />
Three tea spoonsful of cayenne pepper,<br />
Two table spoonsful of whole allspice,<br />
As much vinegar as will cover it.<br />
</p>

<p>Split the shad open, rub over it two table spoonsful
of salt, and let it stand several hours. Have
ready a pot with boiling water in it sufficient to
cover the shad, allowing a tea spoonful of salt to
every quart of water. Boil it twenty minutes.
Take it out of the water, drain it, bruise your allspice
just so as to crack the grains. Sprinkle over
your shad the allspice and pepper, and cover it
with cold vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOILED SHAD.</h3>

<p>17. Clean your shad, wash it and wipe it, flour
it well, wrap it in a cloth, and put it into a large
vessel of boiling water with a great deal of salt.
It will require about twenty minutes to cook it.
Serve it with egg sauce, or rich drawn butter.</p>


<h3>FRIED SHAD.</h3>

<p>18. Cut your shad in half, wash it and wipe it
dry, score it and season with cayenne pepper and
salt, dredge flour over it, and fry it in hot lard.
When done, put the two halves together, that it
may assume the appearance of a whole fish.</p>


<h3>BROILED SHAD.</h3>

<p>19. Split your shad down the back, wash it
and season it well with salt. Have your gridiron
heated, grease the bars, put on the shad and broil
it slowly till quite done. It should be of a fine
brown on both sides. If designed for the dinner
table, after having basted it well with butter on
both sides, fold it over, that it may assume its original
form, and serve it.</p>


<h3>BAKED SHAD.</h3>

<p>20. Open your shad by cutting it down the
back, wash it well and wipe it dry, score it and
season it with cayenne pepper and salt; put it in a
pan with two ounces of butter cut in small pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
put a few pieces of butter in the bottom of the pan
and the remainder on the shad, add two table
spoonsful of water. Place it in a very moderate
oven and let it stand three or four hours.</p>


<h3>SHAD ROASTED ON A BOARD.</h3>

<p>21. Take a piece of clean oak board about
three inches thick, and two feet square, stand it
before the fire till the board is very hot, indeed almost
charred. Have your shad split down the
back, cleaned, washed, wiped dry, and seasoned
with salt; fasten it to the hot board with a few small
nails; the skin side should be next the board, place
the board before the fire with the head part down;
as soon as the juices begin to run, turn it with the
tail down; it should be turned frequently in order
to retain the juices. When done butter it and serve
it hot. Send it to the table on the board.</p>

<p>This is the receipt for baking shad at the Philadelphia
"fish house."</p>


<h3>POTTED SHAD, No. 1.</h3>

<p>22. Cut a shad in six or eight pieces, wash and
wipe it dry. Mix one dessert spoonful of ground
allspice, half a table spoonful of black pepper, and
half a table spoonful of salt&mdash;sprinkle a portion of
this seasoning over each piece of shad. Put them
into a stone jar with enough good cider vinegar to
cover them; cover the jar with a clean cloth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
over this tie closely several thicknesses of brown
paper to keep in the steam; set it in a moderate
oven and let it remain twelve hours.</p>

<p>This is very good, but the fish is dark colored.
When potted according to <a href="#Article_23">No. 2</a>, it retains its
whiteness.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_23" id="Article_23">POTTED SHAD, No. 2.</a></h3>

<p>23. Cut a shad in about half a dozen pieces,
wash it and wipe it dry. Mix together two table
spoonsful of whole allspice and one table spoonful
of whole black pepper; put one table spoonful and
a half of salt over the shad the evening before it is
to be potted, the next morning sprinkle over it a
half a tea spoonful of cayenne pepper. Place the
shad in a stone jar, and over each layer throw a
portion of the grains of pepper and allspice, cover
it with vinegar and set it in a moderate oven for
twelve hours.</p>


<h3>HALIBUT.</h3>

<p>24. Cut it in slices about a quarter of an inch
thick; wash and dry them, season with cayenne pepper
and salt; have ready a pan of hot lard and fry
your fish in it till of a delicate brown on both sides.</p>

<p>Some dip the cutlets in beaten egg and then in
bread crumbs and fry it. When done in this manner
it should be cut rather thinner than according
to the first method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, heat your gridiron, grease the bars, season
your fish with cayenne pepper and salt, and broil it
till of a fine brown color. Lay it on a dish and
butter it.</p>


<h3>CAT FISH.</h3>

<p>25. Cut each fish in two parts, down the back
and stomach; take out the upper part of the back
bone next the head; wash and wipe them dry, season
with cayenne pepper and salt, and dredge flour
over them; fry them in hot lard of a nice light
brown.</p>

<p>Some dress them like oysters; they are then dipped
in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fried in
hot lard. They are very nice dipped in beaten
egg, without the crumbs, and fried.</p>


<h3>POTTED HERRING.</h3>

<p>26. Clean your herring, wash them well and
wipe them dry; then rub each one with salt and
cayenne pepper; place in your jar a layer of herring,
then some grains of allspice, half a dozen
cloves, and two or three blades of mace; then put
in another layer of herring, and so on till all are
in; cover the herring with cold vinegar, tie up the
jar closely with several thicknesses of paper, and
set it in the oven after the bread has been drawn
out; let it remain there all night. As soon as they
become cold they will be fit for use.</p>

<h2><a name="SHELL_FISH" id="SHELL_FISH">SHELL FISH.</a></h2>


<h3>PICKLED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>27. Take one hundred oysters out of their
liquor, and add to them as much water as there
was liquor. Put them over the fire, with salt to
the taste, skim them, and as soon as they boil take
them off. Have ready in a pan one gill of vinegar,
one table spoonful of allspice, one table spoonful of
pepper grains, a little cayenne pepper and mace,
half a gill of pepper vinegar and half a gill of common
vinegar. They should be pickled the day
before they are to be eaten. After standing a few
hours, if a scum should have risen on them, take
out the oysters and strain the liquor. About six
hours before they are to be served, slice a lemon
and add to them.</p>


<h3>FRIED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>28. Select the largest oysters for frying. Take
them out of their liquor with a fork, and endeavor
in doing so, to rinse off all the particles of shell
which may adhere to them. Dry them between
napkins; have ready some grated cracker, seasoned
with cayenne pepper and salt. Beat the yelks
only of some eggs, and to each egg add half a table
spoonful of thick cream. Dip the oysters, one
at a time, first in the egg then in the cracker
crumbs, and fry them in plenty of hot butter, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
butter and lard mixed, till they are of a light
brown on both sides. Serve them hot.</p>


<h3>STEWED OYSTERS, No. 1.</h3>

<p>29. Take one hundred large oysters, add to
them a quarter of a pound of butter, with salt, black
and red pepper to the taste. Stew <em>as fast as possible</em>
for three minutes. Serve them hot.</p>


<h3>STEWED OYSTERS, No. 2.</h3>

<p>30. Rinse one hundred oysters, and put them
in a stew pan with the water which adheres to
them; season them with salt and cayenne pepper,
and a very little mace. As soon as they begin to
boil pour in half a pint of cream, and stir in half
an ounce of butter rolled in a little grated cracker.
Let them boil once and serve them hot.</p>


<h3>SCALLOPED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>31. Drain your oysters, and season them with
salt and cayenne pepper; crumb some stale bread,
and season it with salt and pepper. To each gill
of the bread crumbs add one hard boiled egg,
finely chopped; butter a deep dish, strew in a layer
of egg and crumbs, then a layer of the oysters,
with some lumps of butter on them, then more
crumbs, and so on till all are in. Put a cover of
crumbs on the top. Bake this in a tolerably quick
oven and serve it hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<h3>OYSTER FRITTERS.</h3>

<p>32. Drain the oysters and wipe them dry; season
them with salt, if they are not salt enough;
make a batter in the proportion of a pint of milk
to three eggs, and flour to thicken it; beat the
yelks till they are very thick, stir in the milk and
as much flour as will make a batter, but not a very
thick one; add a pinch of salt, beat the whole very
hard, whisk the whites to a stiff dry froth and stir
them in gently at the last. Put a small spoonful
of the batter in a pan of boiling lard, then lay an
oyster on the top, and over this put a little more
batter; when they are brown on both sides, put
them on a dish and send them to the table hot.</p>


<h3>OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>33. Take one hundred oysters out of their liquor,
one at a time, so as to free them from any
portions of the shell which might adhere to them.
Drain and place them between clean napkins in
order to dry them perfectly; pour off half the liquor
into a stew-pan, salt it to your taste, stir in one
gill of cream, one ounce and a half of butter rolled
in grated cracker, and a little cayenne pepper; boil
two eggs hard, chop them up, and mix them with
as many bread crumbs as will cover the top of your
pie; season the bread and egg with cayenne pepper
and salt, make a rich paste, line the sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
your pie dish, put in the oysters, pour the hot liquor
over them, strew the bread crumbs on the
top, cover the whole with a lid of paste, cut an
opening in the centre of the top crust, and ornament
it with flowers or leaves made of the paste, bake it
and serve it hot. As soon as the crust is done take
the pie out of the oven.</p>


<h3>ROASTED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>34. Wash the shells perfectly clean, put them
in pans and set them in the oven, or place them in
rows on the top of your kitchen range. Those
who live in the country, and have large wood fires,
may roast them nicely on their hot hearth stone.
Take them up as soon as the shells begin to open,
before the liquor is lost; have ready a hot vegetable
dish, take out the oysters and serve immediately.
Or, the upper shell may be taken off, and
the oysters placed on broad dishes in the other
shell. The dishes must be well heated as the oysters
should be eaten hot.</p>

<p>Each person dresses his oysters on his plate.</p>


<h3>OYSTER OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>
35. Eight oysters chopped fine,<br />
Six eggs,<br />
A wine glassful of flour,<br />
A little milk,<br />
Pepper and salt to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Beat the eggs very light, add the oysters and the
flour, which must be mixed to a paste with a little
milk; pepper and salt to the taste. Fry it in hot
butter, but do not turn it; as soon as it is done
slip it on a dish and serve it hot.</p>

<p>The above is the usual mode of preparing oyster
omelette; but the better way is to put your oysters
in a stew pan, set them over the fire, and the moment
they begin to boil take them out, drain them
and dry them in a napkin. They are not so watery
when prepared in this manner, and consequently
will not dilute the beaten egg as much as
the former mode. When they are cold mince them
and proceed as above.</p>


<h3>STEWED CLAMS.</h3>

<p>36. Wash the clams, put them in a pot and
cover them closely; set them near the fire, and as
soon as they begin to open take them out of the
shell; drain them, and to a pint of clams add half a
pint of water, one ounce of butter rolled in flour,
cayenne pepper and salt to the taste; let them stew
ten minutes. Just before they are to be dished
add one gill of cream.</p>


<h3>CLAM FRITTERS.</h3>

<p>37. Wash your clam shells, put them in a pot
with the water only which adheres to them, cover
the pot closely, and as soon as they open take them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
out of the shell. Take out the hard part and cut
the remainder in half, and season them with pepper
and salt; beat the yelks of four eggs very light, add
to them a pint of milk, a little salt, and flour
enough to form a batter; whisk the whites very
dry and add them at the last. Have ready a pan
of hot lard, put in a spoonful of the batter, lay on
the top two or three pieces of the clams, then cover
them with a little more of the batter. Fry them
on both sides and serve them hot.</p>

<p>The small sand clams are the best kind.</p>


<h3>FRIED CLAMS.</h3>

<p>38. Wash your clams before they are opened;
place them in a vessel without any water. Cover
the vessel closely and as soon as they open their
mouths take them out of the shell. Dry them in
a napkin, season them with cayenne pepper and
salt if necessary, and fry them in butter. Or, they
may be fried in egg and bread crumbs as oysters.</p>


<h3>TERRAPINS.</h3>

<p>39. Put the terrapins on in boiling water and
let them boil ten minutes, take them out and with
a coarse cloth rub all the skin off the head, neck,
and claws, also the thin shell that may come loose.
Then boil them in clean water, with a little salt in
it, until the claws are perfectly soft. The time of
boiling depends very much on the age of the terra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>pin;
some take three hours. When they are soft,
open them carefully, take out the sand bag, the
spongy part, and the gall, which you must not
break. Cut all the remainder of the terrapin in
small pieces, put them in a stew pan, and to each
large terrapin take a quarter of a pound of butter,
one wine glass of Sherry or Madeira wine, salt,
black and red pepper, and mustard, to suit the taste,
also to each terrapin, the yelks of two hard boiled
eggs, mashed to a paste, with a little butter. Mix
the whole together, and stew fifteen minutes. Send
them to the table hot.</p>


<h3>BOILED CRABS.</h3>

<p>40. Have a large pot of water strongly salted,
let it boil hard, put in your crabs and boil them for
twenty minutes. If the water should cease boiling
the crabs will be watery. Take them out, break
off the claws, wipe the shells very clean, also the
large claws.</p>

<p>When cold, place them on a dish with the large
claws around it. The claws should be cracked before
they are sent to the table. The small ones are
not generally eaten.</p>


<h3>SOFT CRABS.</h3>

<p>41. Prepare your crabs by removing the spongy
part, and sand bag. Wipe them very clean and
fry them in some hot lard and butter mixed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
they are a fine yellow brown on both sides, place
them on a dish and send them to the table hot.</p>


<h3>BOILED LOBSTER.</h3>

<p>42. Lobsters, as well as crabs, should be boiled
in strong salt and water. Have your pot of water
boiling hard, put in your lobsters and boil them for
half an hour, or if they are very large, a little longer.
Take them out of the pot and when they
have drained, open them, extract the meat carefully,
and send it to the table cold.</p>

<p>Lobster is usually dressed at the table with mustard,
hard boiled eggs, cayenne pepper, salt, vinegar
and oil.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER SALAD.</h3>

<p>
43. One large lobster,<br />
Three table spoonsful of French mustard, or,<br />
Two dessert spoonsful of common mixed mustard,<br />
One gill and a half of vinegar,<br />
One gill and a half of sweet oil,<br />
The yelks of five hard boiled eggs,<br />
Salt to the taste,<br />
A small tea spoonful of cayenne pepper,<br />
The inside leaves of two heads of cabbage lettuce.<br />
</p>

<p>Cut the meat and lettuce in small pieces. Boil
the eggs hard, mash the yelks with a wooden or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
silver spoon, and oil enough to make them to a
smooth paste, then add the vinegar, mustard, pepper,
and salt to the taste. Mix this dressing thoroughly
with the lobster and lettuce, and serve it
before the salad becomes wilted.</p>


<h3>OYSTER OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>44. Beat four eggs very light. Cut the hard
part out of eight or a dozen oysters, according to
their size, wipe them dry, and cut them up in small
pieces, stir them into the beaten egg and fry them
in hot butter. When the under side is brown,
sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the top, and
fold one half over the other.</p>

<p>Never turn an omelette, as it makes it heavy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MEATS" id="MEATS">MEATS.</a></h2>


<p>The finest grained beef is the best, the flesh is
of a fine red, and the fat a light cream color, but
not yellow; the fat, too, is solid and firm. The
lean of mutton should be of a red color, and the
fat white. The lean of veal should be of a light
color and the fat white. The skin of pork should
be of a light color, and if young it is tender. The
fat should appear firm. A tender goose is known
by taking hold of the wing and raising it; if the
skin tears easily, the goose is tender, or if you can
readily insert the head of a pin into the flesh, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
young. The same remarks will hold good with
regard to ducks. Young chickens may be known
by pressing the lower end of the breast bone; if it
yields readily to the pressure they are not old, for
in all animals the bones are cartilaginous when
young. The breast should be broad and plump in
all kinds of poultry, the feet pliable, and the toes
easily broken when bent back.</p>


<h3>ROAST BEEF.</h3>

<p>45. The nicest piece for roasting is the rib.</p>

<p>Two ribs of fine beef is a piece large enough for
a family of eight or ten. The lean of beef should
always appear of a bright red before it is cooked,
and the fat of a very light cream color.</p>

<p>Season the beef with salt, and place it in a roaster
before a clear bright fire. Do not set it too close
at first. As to the time of roasting, that must be
left to the judgment of the cook and the taste of
those who are to eat it. If it is preferred quite
rare an hour and a half or two hours will cook two
large ribs sufficiently, but if it is to be better done,
it must be cooked a proportionably longer time.
Whilst the beef is roasting, baste it frequently with
its own gravy. When nearly done, dredge flour
lightly over it so as to brown it. When the meat
is taken out, skim off the fat on the top of the
gravy, and pour the remainder in a pan, add a little
flour, with salt to the taste, and some water, give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
it one boil, and serve it in a small tureen or gravy
boat.</p>

<p>In cold weather the plates should be warmed
just before the dinner is served. Or, a small chafing
dish placed under each plate.</p>


<h3>BEEF A-LA-MODE.</h3>

<p>46. A round of beef is the best for this purpose.
With a sharp knife cut incisions in the meat about
an inch apart, and within one inch of the opposite
side, season it with pepper and salt according to
the size of the piece of meat.</p>

<p>Make a dressing of butter, onion, and bread
crumbs, in the proportion of a pint of crumbs, one
small onion finely chopped, and an ounce of butter,
with pepper and salt to the taste, fill the incisions
with the dressing, put the meat in a pot, with about
a pint of water, and cover it tightly. Let it simmer
six or eight hours.</p>

<p>Some stick in a few cloves, and those who are
fond of spice add allspice. When the meat is done,
dish it up and thicken the gravy with a little flour.
Let it boil once, and serve it. This is excellent
when cold.</p>


<h3>BEEF STEAKS.</h3>

<p>47. Scrape some fine sirloin steaks, wipe them
with a clean cloth, heat the bars of your gridiron,
grease them, and put your steaks over clear coals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Turn them frequently by placing a dish over them,
and then quickly turn them, holding the dish in one
hand and the gridiron in the other. In this manner
you will preserve the gravy. When done, season
them with pepper and salt; baste them well
with butter, and add two table spoonsful of water,
with a little salt. Send them to the table hot.</p>


<h3>FRIED BEEF STEAK.</h3>

<p>48. Season your steaks with salt and pepper,
and fry them in hot lard. When done, dish them,
add a little flour to the fat they were fried in, pour
in a little water, and season with pepper and salt to
the taste; give the gravy one boil and pour it over.</p>


<h3>SMOTHERED STEAK.</h3>

<p>49. Take one dozen large onions, boil them in
very little water until they are tender.</p>

<p>Pound and wash a beef steak, season it with
pepper and salt, put it in a pan with some hot beef
dripping, and fry it till it is done. Take it out,
put it on a dish, where it will keep hot. Then,
when the onions are soft, drain and mash them in
the pan with the steak gravy, and add pepper and
salt to the taste. Put it on the fire and as soon as
it is hot, pour it over the steak and serve it.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEEF, AND YORKSHIRE PUDDING.</h3>

<p>50. Rub salt on a nice piece of beef, put it on
bars, which should fit your dripping pan, set it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the oven, with a gill of water in the pan, and when
it is half done, make the pudding in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Beat four eggs very light; the yelks in a pan,
the whites in a broad dish. When the yelks are
thick stir in a pint of milk, and as much flour as
will make a batter, but not a thick one. Then stir
in the whites which must be whisked very dry; do
not heat the batter after the white is in; lastly stir
in a tea spoonful of dissolved carbonate of ammonia.
Take out the meat, skim all the fat off the
gravy, pour in the batter and replace the meat;
put all into the oven again, and cook it till the
pudding is done. You should make batter enough
to cover your dripping pan about half an inch deep.
When the meat is dished, cut the pudding in squares,
and place it round the dish, the brown side up.</p>


<h3>FRENCH STEW, No. 1.</h3>

<p>51. Cut up two pounds of beef, and add to it
a pint of sliced tomatoes. The tomatoes must be
peeled. Put the meat in a stew-pan and season it
well with pepper and salt, then add your tomatoes
and an ounce of butter rolled in flour. Cover it
closely, and let it simmer till the beef is tender. It
does not require any water as the tomatoes are sufficiently
juicy.</p>

<p>If the gravy should not be thick enough, add a
little flour mixed with cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h3>FRENCH STEW, No. 2.</h3>

<p>52. Cut up one pound of beef in small pieces
about an inch square, pare and slice six onions;
put a layer of the meat and a layer of onions in a
stew-pan, with salt and pepper and a little flour
alternately till all is in, and add half a tea cupful
of water; cover it closely and set it on a slow fire
to stew; when about half done, if the gravy seems
too thin, add one ounce of butter rolled in flour;
but if it should be thick enough, add the butter
without the flour.</p>

<p>When tomatoes are in season two tomatoes may
be cut in small pieces and stewed with the meat.</p>

<p>Cold beef may be cooked in the same manner.</p>


<h3>BEEF STEWED WITH ONIONS.</h3>

<p>53. Cut some tender beef in small pieces, and season
it with pepper and salt, slice some onions and add
to it, with water enough in the stew-pan to make
a gravy; let it stew slowly till the beef is thoroughly
done, then add some pieces of butter rolled in
flour to make a rich gravy.</p>

<p>Cold beef may be done in the same way, only the
onions must be stewed first and the meat added.
If the water should stew away too much put in a
little more.</p>


<h3>STEWED BEEF'S KIDNEY.</h3>

<p>54. Clear the kidney of all the fat, cut it in two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and with a sharp knife cut out the fibre which runs
through the middle of it. Lay it in a sauce-pan
with a very little water and a little salt, cover it
close and let it stew till it is perfectly tender, then
take it up and cut it in small pieces, season it with
pepper, and more salt if requisite, and return it to
the stew-pan; let it stew till there are about two
spoonsful of gravy remaining in the stew-pan, then
add a piece of butter and a little flour. Let it boil
once and serve it.</p>


<h3>FRIED BEEF'S KIDNEY.</h3>

<p>55. Clean all the fat off the kidney, cut it open
and take out the fibre which runs through it; put
it in a stew-pan with a very little water and some
salt, and cook it till it is tender; then season it
with pepper and more salt if required, flour it and
fry it in hot lard, add a little flour and water to
make the gravy.</p>

<p>Or, you may broil instead of frying it, after it has
been parboiled.</p>


<h3>CORNED BEEF.</h3>

<p>
56. One hundred pounds of beef,<br />
Six pounds of coarse salt,<br />
Two ounces and a half of saltpetre,<br />
One pound and a half of sugar,<br />
Four gallons of water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix the above ingredients together and pour
over the meat. Cover the tub closely.</p>


<h3>JEWISH METHOD OF PREPARING BEEF FOR
SALTING.</h3>

<p>57. Take out all the veins. Sprinkle with
salt and let it lay for half an hour; wash off all
the salt and soak it half an hour in cold water,
drain it and then put it in the pickle as directed
above.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_58" id="Article_58">BOILED CORNED BEEF.</a></h3>

<p>58. Put on the meat in cold water; allow one
quart of water to every pound of meat. The
slower it boils the better it will be. For every
pound of meat let it boil fifteen minutes; thus, a
piece of beef weighing twelve pounds should boil
three hours. If the beef is to be eaten cold&mdash;as
soon as it is taken out of the pot immerse it in cold
water for a short time, in order to retain the
juices.</p>

<p>Tongues are boiled in the same manner.</p>


<h3>BOILED TONGUE.</h3>

<p>59. See boiled corned beef, <a href="#Article_58">Article 58</a>.</p>


<h3>TRIPE.</h3>

<p>60. Scrape and wash it very clean&mdash;put it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
pot with a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of
water, and let it boil till the top of each piece begins
to look clear&mdash;it requires a great deal of boiling
and must be exceedingly soft.</p>

<p>When cold cut it in pieces, season and fry it in
egg and bread crumbs like oysters. Or, it may be
fried without the egg and crumbs, and the gravy
thickened with a little flour, and flavored with
catsup or vinegar. Serve it hot.</p>


<h3>ROAST VEAL.</h3>

<p>61. Season a breast of veal with pepper and
salt; skewer the sweet-bread firmly in its place,
flour the meat and roast it slowly before a moderate
fire for about four hours&mdash;it should be of a fine
brown but not dry; baste it with butter. When
done put the gravy in a stew-pan, add a piece of
butter rolled in browned flour, and if there should
not be quite enough gravy add a little more water,
with pepper and salt to the taste. The gravy
should be brown.</p>


<h3>PLAIN VEAL PIE.</h3>

<p>62. Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut it
in pieces, season it with pepper and salt, and stew
it in just enough water to cover it. When it is
nearly done make a rich gravy with some butter
rolled in flour, added to the water it was stewed in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Line the sides of a deep pie dish with paste,
put in the meat and pour in the gravy, roll out a
sheet of paste and cover the top; cut an opening in
the centre of the top, about three inches long, and
another to cross it at right angles; turn back the
four corners and ornament with bars of paste
twisted and laid over. Set it in the oven, and when
the crust is done send it to the table in the dish it
was baked in.</p>


<h3>VEAL POT PIE.</h3>

<p>63. Cut up some veal, the best part of the neck
is preferable to any other, wash and season it with
pepper and salt; line the sides of your pot with
paste, put in the veal with some pieces of paste
rolled out and cut in squares, cut up some pieces
of butter rolled in flour and add to it, pour in as
much water as will cover it, and lay a sheet of
paste on the top, leaving an opening in the centre;
put the lid on the pot and put it over a moderate
fire, let it cook slowly till the meat is done; place
the soft crust on a dish, then put the meat over it,
and on the top lay the hard crust, with the brown
side up. Serve the gravy in a boat.</p>

<p>To have the crust of a pot pie brown, set the pot
on a few coals before the fire, and turn it frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>


<h3>FILLET OF VEAL A-LA-MODE.</h3>

<p>64. Cut deep incisions in the meat about an
inch apart, and season it with pepper and salt.
Make your dressing with a four cent baker's loaf,
two small onions finely chopped, and an ounce of
butter, with pepper and salt to the taste; fill the
incisions with this dressing, put the veal in a pot
with three gills of water and cover it tightly. Let
it cook slowly two hours at least. Some prefer a
little sweet marjoram or thyme, finely powdered,
added to the dressing. Take out the veal when it
is done, and thicken the gravy with a little flour.</p>


<h3>BAKED FILLET OF VEAL.</h3>

<p>65. Make incisions all around the bone as
closely as possible, so as not to touch each other.
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, an onion finely
chopped, a little sweet marjoram, pepper and salt
to the taste, with enough butter to cause the bread
crumbs to adhere together; fill these incisions with
the dressing, season the meat with pepper and salt,
and skewer the strip of fat around it. Pour in
enough water to cover the bottom of the pan, put
in the rack and place the meat on it; as the gravy
stews away add a little more water, put it in a cool
oven and let it cook three or four hours. When
done, make the gravy with some flour rolled in
butter, and add pepper and salt to the taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>


<h3>FRENCH STEW OF VEAL.</h3>

<p>66. Boil a knuckle of veal in just enough water
to cover it, with a little salt. When the veal is
tender pour off the water it was boiled in and save
it. Cut the veal in small pieces and put it in a
pan with the water it was boiled in. Add to this
two hard boiled eggs, chopped very fine, a table
spoonful of allspice in grains, (which should be
crushed but not broken fine) a quarter of a pound
of butter, a little mace and pepper, and salt to the
taste. Stir two table spoonsful of flour smoothly
in a little water, and pour into it. Set it over the
fire, let it boil for two or three minutes, pour in
two glasses of wine, and serve it hot.</p>


<h3>STEWED VEAL.</h3>

<p>67. Cut a slice of the cutlet in small pieces,
season it with pepper, salt, and, if you prefer it,
a little grated lemon peel and nutmeg. Pour in as
much water as will nearly cover it, let it cook slowly
till about half done, then make a rich gravy with
some pieces of butter rolled in flour, and add to
the water it was stewed in.</p>


<h3>VEAL CUTLETS.</h3>

<p>63. Cut the veal in thin slices, pound and wash
it, then dry it in a clean cloth. Beat some egg,
and have ready some bread crumbs, or grated
cracker. Season the meat with salt, pepper, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
little mace, dip each slice in the egg, then in the
crumbs, and fry them in hot lard. They should be
brown on both sides.</p>


<h3>FRIED VEAL WITH TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>69. Cut some veal in thin slices, season it and
fry it of a nice brown. Have ready some tomatoes
which have been stewed very dry; pass them through
a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'seive'">sieve</ins> to take out the seeds. Then put them into
the pan in which the meat has been fried and add
butter enough to make a rich gravy. Pour them
hot over the veal and serve it.</p>

<p>Beef is excellent cooked in the same way.</p>


<h3>PLAIN FRIED VEAL.</h3>

<p>70. Cut the meat in thin slices, pound and wash
them. Season with pepper and salt, and fry them
in hot lard, of a nice brown, on both sides. When
the meat is done stir a little flour into the fat and
pour in some water; set the pan over the fire, let
it boil once, then pour it over the veal, and send it
to the table.</p>


<h3>SPICED VEAL.</h3>

<p>71. Take some of the thick part of a cold loin
of veal, cut it in small pieces, and pour over as
much hot spiced vinegar as will cover it.</p>

<p>To half a pint of vinegar put a tea spoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
allspice, a very little mace, salt and cayenne pepper
to the taste.</p>


<h3>FRIED SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>72. Parboil them in salt and water; when done,
take them up and dry them in a cloth. With a
sharp knife, cut them in half, season them with
pepper and salt, and flour them, fry them in hot
lard, of a light brown. Or they may be fried as
oysters, with egg and bread crumbs, or grated
crackers.</p>


<h3>STEWED SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>73. Put them on in very little water with some
salt, when they have cooked slowly for half an
hour, take them out. Cut them in small pieces,
and return them to the liquor they were boiled in.
Make a rich gravy of butter rolled in flour, and
pepper and salt to the taste. Mace and nutmeg
may be added if preferred.</p>


<h3>BOILED SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>74. Wash and dry them, and rub them with
dry flour and a little salt, then put them in a stew-pan,
with water sufficient to keep them from burning.
When they are tender, put them in a dish
and pour over a rich drawn butter.</p>


<h3>SPICED CALVES' FEET.</h3>

<p>75. Boil them as directed for fried calves' feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in the following receipt, and save the liquor they
were boiled in. When cold, cut them in pieces, and
put them in a jar; take equal portions of the liquor
they were boiled in, and good sharp vinegar; to
every pint of this mixture add a tea spoonful of
allspice crushed, two or three blades of mace, and
salt and cayenne pepper to the taste. Heat the
vinegar, liquor, and spices together, and pour it
hot over the feet.</p>

<p>This makes a good dish for tea or breakfast.</p>


<h3>FRIED CALVES' FEET.</h3>

<p>76. Boil them in very little water, with some
salt. There should be no more water than barely
sufficient to cook them. When they are tender,
cut them in half, and place them on a dish to get
cold. Save the liquor they were boiled in. When
they are to be fried season them with pepper and
salt, dredge flour over them and fry them in hot
lard or butter.</p>

<p>They should be of a handsome brown on both
sides when done. Put some of the liquor they were
boiled in, in the pan, and make a rich gravy with
some pieces of butter rolled in flour. Pour this
over the fried feet, and send them to the table.</p>


<h3>FRIED CALVES' LIVER.</h3>

<p>77. Cut the liver in thin slices and lay them in
salt and water for several hours, to draw out all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the blood. Then season them with pepper and salt,
and fry them in hot lard. When they are done,
thicken the gravy with a little flour, and add a
little water. Let it boil once, pour it over the liver,
and serve it.</p>

<p>It should be fried slowly, or it will be brown on
the outside before it is done through. Some prefer
the liver fried without any gravy made for it. In
that case, lay the slices on the dish and serve.</p>

<p>It may be broiled and buttered.</p>


<h3>CHITTERLINGS, OR CALVES' TRIPE.</h3>

<p>78. Wash them and put them on to boil in
water enough to cover them, with a little salt.
When they are quite tender, drain them, put them
on a dish, and pour over them a rich drawn butter.</p>


<h3>ROAST LEG OF LAMB.</h3>

<p>79. Cut deep incisions round the bone and in
the flesh; make a dressing of bread crumbs, salt,
pepper, sweet marjoram, or summer savory, and as
much butter as will make the crumbs adhere together.
Fill all the incisions with the dressing,
season the meat with salt and pepper, put it on the
spit and roast it before a clear fire; when nearly
done dredge flour over and baste it with the gravy.</p>

<p>Skim the fat off the gravy, and add a little flour,
mixed with water; let it boil once, and serve it in
a gravy boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOILED LEG OF LAMB.</h3>

<p>80. Trim off all the loose fat, cut off the shank,
wash and wipe it dry; dredge it with flour and tie
it in a clean cloth; put it in boiling water enough
to cover it. The water should be salted in the
proportion of two tea spoonsful of salt to a quart of
water. Let it boil from two to three hours according
to its size. Serve it with drawn butter or rich
parsley sauce, which ever may be preferred, and
vegetables of any kind which may be in season.</p>


<h3>LAMB STEWED WITH ONIONS.</h3>

<p>81. This is a French dish. Peel some onions,
cut them in slices, and put them in your stew-pan;
cut off the ends of the chops, pound them, and lay
them in with the onions and some pepper and salt.
Put in as much water as will cook them; let them
stew slowly till they are tender, then add a piece
of butter rolled in flour to thicken the gravy.</p>


<h3>MUTTON DRESSED LIKE VENISON.</h3>

<p>82. Hang a leg of mutton and let it freeze.
Then cut from it slices about a quarter of an inch
thick, cook them at the table in a chafing dish with
butter and currant jelly, and salt and pepper to the
taste.</p>


<h3>MUTTON CHOPS.</h3>

<p>83. Trim your mutton chops, take off the loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
fat, and heat your gridiron; grease the bars, put on
the chops over clear coals, turn them frequently,
and when done put them in a dish, butter them
well and season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>They may be served with slices of lemon.</p>


<h3>MUTTON CHOPS WITH LEMON.</h3>

<p>84. Wash the chops, wipe them dry, grease the
bars of your gridiron, and broil them over hot
coals. When they are done lay them on a dish
and season them with pepper and salt, and baste
them with butter; peel and slice lemons, lay a slice
on each chop and send them to the table.</p>

<p>This is the French method of serving them.</p>


<h3>ROAST PORK.</h3>

<p>85. Take a nice middle piece of young pork,
separate the joints and crack the bones across the
middle, but do not break the skin, score it parallel
with the ribs, wash it, put it on the spit, with a
little water in the bottom of the roaster, and to five
pounds of pork rub in well two tea spoonsful and
a half of salt, two tea spoonsful of sage and one of
cayenne pepper. Put no flour on it nor baste it
while cooking, as it softens the skin and makes it
tough. Pour the gravy into a pan, skim off a part
of the fat, stir in a little flour mixed with cold
water, add some water and let it boil once, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
serve it in a gravy tureen. If it should not be sufficiently
seasoned, add a little more pepper or salt,
as it may require.</p>

<p>Apple sauce is always served with roast pork.</p>


<h3>ROAST PIG.</h3>

<p>86. Prepare the pig by cutting off the feet,
scraping and cleansing the head and ears, cutting
out the tongue and eyes, and cleaning the throat.
Wash it perfectly clean and wipe it dry. Make a
dressing of bread crumbs, some onions finely chopped,
with salt, pepper, and sweet marjoram to the
taste, also butter enough to make the crumbs adhere
together. Any spice may be added, and the
grating of a lemon, but many prefer the dressing
without spice.</p>

<p>Rub the pig thoroughly inside with salt, cayenne
pepper, and powdered sage, then fill it with the
dressing and sew it up. Rub the outside with salt,
cayenne pepper and sage, put it on the spit and
place it before a clear, but not too hot a fire.
Have a piece of clean sponge tied on a stick, dip it
in melted butter, and as the skin dries moisten it.
A common sized pig takes from three to four hours
to roast. An excellent filling may be made of potatoes
boiled and mashed instead of the bread. If
potatoes are used the dressing will require more
butter.</p>

<p>Roast pig is always served with haslet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
For directions for making it see under the head of
Sauces. Apple sauce is also thought to be an indispensable
accompaniment to roast pig.</p>


<h3>STUFFED LEG OF PORK.</h3>

<p>87. Make deep incisions in the meat parallel to
the bone; trim it so as to leave the skin longer
than the flesh; then boil some potatoes, when they
are done mash them with a piece of butter, cayenne
pepper, salt, and an onion finely chopped and a little
rubbed sage. With this dressing fill the incisions,
draw the skin down and skewer it over to keep the
dressing from falling out; season the outside of the
meat with salt, cayenne pepper, and rubbed sage;
roast it slowly; when it is done pour the gravy in a
pan, skim off the fat, and add a little flour mixed
with water; let it boil once. Serve it with apple
or cranberry sauce. Some prefer a dressing made
of bread crumbs instead of potatoes.</p>


<h3>PORK STEAKS.</h3>

<p>88. Cut the steaks in thin slices, season them
with cayenne pepper, salt, and rubbed sage. They
may be broiled and buttered, or fried in hot lard,
with a gravy thickened with a little flour and
poured over them.</p>


<h3>LEG OF PORK CORNED AND BOILED.</h3>

<p>89. Mix salt and sugar together, in the proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of a table spoonful of salt to one tea spoonful of
sugar; with this mixture rub your meat all over
well, let it stand three days, and turn it every day.
Have boiling water enough to cover it, put in the
meat, and if the water should boil away put more
in; when it is tender, serve it with tomatoes, cabbage,
turnips, or any vegetables in season.</p>


<h3>SPARE RIB.</h3>

<p>90. Crack the ribs across, separate the joints,
wash it and season it with cayenne pepper, salt, and
rubbed sage; put it on the spit and cook it slowly
till it is done. This is served without gravy.</p>

<p>Or, it may be prepared in the same manner and
broiled on the gridiron.</p>


<h3>SOUSED PIG'S FEET.</h3>

<p>91. After they have been well scalded and
cleaned, wash them, and put them on to boil in a
sufficiency of water to cover them, with two tea
spoonsful of salt to a quart of water. Let them
boil till the bones are all loose and the flesh nearly
ready to fall to pieces. Take them out and lay
them on a dish to get cold, and save the liquor they
were boiled in; mix equal portions of the liquor and
good sharp vinegar, with whole allspice, a few
cloves, pepper and salt to the taste. Heat the
vinegar and spice, and pour it over them. They may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
be sent to the table cold, or they may be heated
with a portion of the vinegar.</p>

<p>The feet may be boiled as for the souse, and
when cold, cut in half, dredged with flour, and fried
brown.</p>


<h3>SCRAPPLE.</h3>

<p>92. This is generally made of the head, feet,
and any pieces which may be left after having made
sausage meat.</p>

<p>Scrape and wash well all the pieces designed for
the scrapple, put them in a pot with just as much
water as will cover them. Add a little salt, and
let them boil slowly till the flesh is perfectly soft,
and the bones loose. Take all the meat out of the
pot, pick out the bones, cut it up fine, and return
it to the liquor in the pot. Season it with pepper,
salt, and rubbed sage, to the taste. Set the pot
over the fire, and just before it begins to boil, stir
in gradually as much Indian meal as will make it
as thick as thick mush. Let it boil a few minutes,
take it off, and pour it in pans. When cold, cut it
in slices, flour it, and fry it in hot lard, or sausage
fat.</p>

<p>Some prefer buckwheat meal; this is added in
the same manner as the Indian. Indian meal is preferable,
as it is not so solid as buckwheat.</p>

<p>Sweet marjoram may be added with the sage, if
preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOGS-HEAD CHEESE.</h3>

<p>93. Clean a pig's head nicely, wash it well, and
boil it in very little water, with some salt. Let it
boil until the bones fall from the flesh. Then take
it up, pick out all the bones, and with a wooden
spoon mash it up well, and return it to the water
it was boiled in. Add red and black pepper, rubbed
sage and sweet marjoram to the taste. Boil
the whole down till it is quite thick and nearly dry;
then pour it in pans or forms, smooth it over the
top with the back of a spoon, and stand it away to
get cold. Cut it in slices and send it to the table.</p>

<p>Some prefer spice in hogs-head cheese; in that
case, add a small quantity of ground cloves and
mace.</p>


<h3>BOILED HAM.</h3>

<p>94. Wash and scrape your ham; if it is not
very salt it need not be soaked; if old and dry, let
it soak twelve hours in lukewarm water, which
should be changed several times. Put it in a large
vessel filled with cold water. Let it simmer, but
be careful not to let it boil, as it hardens and
toughens the meat. Allow twenty minutes to cook
each pound of meat.</p>

<p>When it is done, take it out of the water, strip
off the skin, and serve it. Twist scalloped letter
paper round the shank, or ornament it with sprigs
of green parsley neatly twisted round it. If it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
not to be eaten whilst hot, as soon as it is taken
from the pot, set it away to get cold, then skin it,
by which means you preserve all the juices of the
meat. It may be garnished as above, or, if you
choose, you may glaze it; the receipt for which
see under its proper head.</p>


<h3>GLAZED HAM.</h3>

<p>95. Beat the yelks of two eggs very light, cover
your ham all over with the beaten egg, then sift
over some grated cracker, and set the ham in the
oven to brown the glazing.</p>


<h3>SAUSAGE MEAT.</h3>

<p>
96. Twenty-five pounds of pork,<br />
Half a pint of salt,<br />
One gill of rubbed sage,<br />
Half a gill of black pepper,<br />
One table spoonful of cayenne pepper.<br />
</p>


<h3>TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF VENISON.</h3>

<p>97. Put your venison on a spit before a clear,
steady fire, cover it with some thick paper to keep
it from burning, and place it at a sufficient distance
from the fire, that it may not brown too soon. The
paper may be fastened on by sticking through it
two or three large darning needles. Turn the spit
frequently, and baste the meat with butter. Venison
is very unpalatable if too much cooked; about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
two hours will be sufficient. It should never be
roasted unless it is fat. A gravy may be made of
the trimmings of the haunch stewed in very little
water, to which add the drippings from the meat,
season with pepper and salt, and thicken with butter
rolled in flour.</p>

<p>Some baste with melted butter and wine mixed
together. Serve with currant jelly.</p>


<h3>VENISON STEAKS.</h3>

<p>98. Cut your venison in slices, pound it, and
having heated your gridiron, grease the bars and
place the meat on it. Broil the venison very quickly
over clear coals, and as soon as it is done put it on
a dish, season with pepper and salt and plenty of
butter. Send it to the table immediately. Serve
it with currant jelly. The plates should be warm.</p>


<h3>BEST WAY OF COOKING VENISON.</h3>

<p>99. Cut your venison in rather thin slices, pound
them, lay them on a dish, and send them to the
table.</p>

<p>Have a chafing-dish on the table, lay some of
the slices of venison in the pan of the chafing-dish,
throw on a little salt, but not so much as for other
meat, a lump of butter, and some currant jelly, put
the cover on the dish, let it remain a minute or two,
take off the cover, turn the slices of meat, place it
on again, and in two or three minutes more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
venison will be sufficiently cooked. Each person
at the table adds pepper to suit the taste. Some
prefer venison cooked without currant jelly.</p>


<h3>ROASTED RABBIT.</h3>

<p>100. Cut off the head, open and wash it clean,
and fill it with a dressing made of bread crumbs,
some onions finely chopped, pepper, salt, a little
powdered mace, and as much butter as will cause
the crumbs to adhere together; sew the rabbit up
after the dressing is in, put it on a spit before the
fire, and baste it with butter, whilst it is roasting.
Or it may be put in a pan with a little water, and
baked.</p>

<p>Make a gravy of a gill of water, an ounce of
butter, an onion finely chopped, pepper, salt and
mace to the taste.</p>

<p>Wine may be added, if preferred.</p>


<h3>BAKED RABBIT PIE.</h3>

<p>101. Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it, and season
it with salt and pepper. Nearly cover it with cold
water, and stew it till it is tender, then add three
ounces of butter rolled in flour. If it should not
be seasoned sufficiently, add more pepper, as rabbits
require more seasoning than many other kinds
of meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Make a paste, butter your pie dish, and line the
sides. Place the pieces of rabbit in the dish, and
add just enough of the gravy to keep it from burning,
then cover it with a lid of paste, leave an
opening on the top, which may be ornamented with
strips of paste, and bake it. It should be served
in the dish it is baked in. Keep the remainder of
the gravy hot, but do not let it boil or simmer,
serve it in a gravy boat, or fill the pie with the
gravy just before it is sent to the table.</p>


<h3>RABBIT POT PIE.</h3>

<p>102. Cut a rabbit in small pieces, season it
highly with salt and pepper. Make a paste, line the
sides of a pot with the crust, then put in the rabbit,
with three ounces of butter cut up and rolled
in flour. Roll out some of the dough, cut it in
pieces about three inches square, and lay it in with
the pieces of rabbit; pour in as much water as will
cover it, roll out a sheet of paste and place on the
top, leaving an opening in the centre. Cover the
pot with the lid, and let it cook slowly till the rabbit
is done.</p>

<p>If when your pie is nearly done, the gravy should
not be thick enough, add a few more pieces of butter
rolled in flour.</p>

<p>When the pie is done put the top or soft crust at
the bottom of the dish, lay the rabbit on it, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
place the brown crust on the top with the brown
side up. Serve the gravy in a gravy boat.</p>


<h3>FRENCH STEWED RABBIT.</h3>

<p>103. Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it, and put it
in a stew-pan with salt, pepper, a little mace, and
a quarter of a tea spoonful of ground allspice; put
in water enough to keep it from sticking to the
pan; cover it closely and let it stew very slowly.
When about half done add a quarter of a pound of
butter, cut in pieces, and rolled in flour, and half a
pint of claret wine. If the meat should not be seasoned
enough, add more salt, pepper or spice.
Rabbit requires a great deal of seasoning, especially
pepper.</p>

<p>Serve it hot. This dish is much esteemed by
many Americans.</p>


<h3><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'FRICASEED'">FRICASSEED</ins> RABBIT.</h3>

<p>104. Cut your rabbit in pieces, wash it and put
it in a stew-pan with three gills of water, season it
with salt, and <em>very highly</em> with pepper, a little
mace, and powdered cloves; let it stew very slowly,
and when nearly done add three ounces of butter
rolled in flour. If you wish a brown fricassee the
flour should be browned before it is rolled with the
butter; if it is to be a white fricassee, after you stir
in the flour and butter add a gill of cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>


<h3>SMOTHERED RABBIT.</h3>

<p>105. Clean a rabbit, cut off the head, wash it
well, and skewer it as if for roasting. Put it in a
stew-pan with half a pint of water, some pepper,
salt, mace, and cloves, and let it simmer very
slowly; keep the stew-pan covered in order to retain
the steam. When half done add a quarter of
a pound of butter rolled in flour. If the water
should stew away too much a little more may be
added. Peel some onions and boil them till they
are tender, drain and chop them fine, season with
salt, pepper and butter to the taste. When the
rabbit is done place it upon the dish it is to be served
in, then put the onions into the gravy and give them
one boil, pour them over the rabbit and serve hot.</p>


<h3>ROASTED PIGEONS.</h3>

<p>106. Pick the pigeons, draw and wash them; dry
them on a clean napkin, rub them inside and outside
with pepper and salt; fill them with a dressing
of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, butter, and a little
onion finely minced; skewer them, or if you choose,
tie them round with tape; put them on the spit and
baste them frequently with butter. About twenty
minutes will cook them.</p>


<h3>STEWED PIGEONS.</h3>

<p>107. Cut the pigeons down the back, clean
them, cut them in four pieces, and wash and wipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
them dry. Put them in a stew-pan, and for each
pair of pigeons roll an ounce of butter in a little
flour, add some pepper and salt, and water enough
just to cover them; stew them till they are tender.
If the gravy should not be thick enough add a little
more flour.</p>

<p>Pigeons are prepared in the same way for pies.</p>


<h3>BROILED SQUAB.</h3>

<p>108. Young pigeons or squabs are the nicest
for broiling. Cut them down the back, clean them
nicely, wash them and dry them on a clean napkin.
Have ready a bed of clear coals, heat your gridiron,
grease the bars to prevent the pigeons from
sticking, and place them over the fire; turn them
frequently, and be careful not to let the legs and
wings burn. When they are done put them on a
dish, season them with pepper and salt, and baste
them well with butter on both sides.</p>


<h3>PIGEON PIE.</h3>

<p>109. This is made in the same manner as
<a href="#Article_122">chicken pie</a>.</p>


<h3>STEWED REED BIRDS, No. 1.</h3>

<p>110. Pick the birds, and cut and clean them
like chickens. Make a force meat of cold veal,
finely chopped with a little grated ham, some pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>dered
nutmeg and mace, and a very small portion
of cloves; season the birds inside with pepper and
salt, fill them with the dressing, rub them on the
outside with pepper and salt, tie the legs down with
a piece of thread, which must be cut off when the
birds are dished. Place them in the stew-pan with
a piece of butter on each and a little flour; put a
little water in the bottom of the stew-pan to keep
them from burning, and cover them close; when
they are tender take them out, cut off the threads,
and if the gravy should not be thick enough, add
some butter rolled in flour. Pour the gravy over
them and serve them hot.</p>


<h3>STEWED REED BIRDS, No. 2.</h3>

<p>111. Pick and singe them, and with a pair of
scissors cut them down the back; or they may be
drawn in the same way as chickens. Wash them
and dry them on a clean cloth; season with pepper
and salt, place a layer of birds at the bottom of
your stew-pan, dredge a little flour over them, and
add some lumps of butter; then put in another
layer of the birds, and so on till all are in. Pour
over them just enough water to keep them from
burning, cover the stew-pan and let the birds cook
slowly. When they are done take them up, and
if the gravy is not thick enough, add a little butter
rolled in flour, let it boil once and pour it over the
birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<h3>ROASTED REED BIRDS.</h3>

<p>112. Pick your birds, and with a pair of scissors
cut and draw them as chickens. Wash them
clean and wipe them dry; make a dressing of bread
crumbs, pepper, salt and butter enough to make
the crumbs adhere together; chopped onion may
be added, with a small quantity of any kind of
sweet herb, finely powdered. Fill the birds with
this dressing, sew them up, put them on a spit, and
baste them with butter whilst they are roasting.</p>


<h3>REED BIRD PIE.</h3>

<p>113. Cut your birds in half, wash them and
wipe them dry; season with pepper and salt. Line
the sides of your pie dish with paste, then place in
a layer of reed birds; over these dredge a little
flour and put some lumps of butter; then put in
another layer of birds, and flour, and butter, till
all are in. Put in enough water to make the gravy,
cover with a lid of paste, and bake in a moderate
oven. Leave an opening in the centre of the top
crust to let the steam escape.</p>


<h3>FRIED REED BIRDS.</h3>

<p>114. Pick them, cut them down the back with
a pair of scissors, wash them and dry them in a
cloth, season with salt and pepper, dip each one
first into some yolk of egg well beaten, then into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
bread crumbs or grated cracker, and fry them in
hot lard and butter mixed in equal portions.</p>

<p>The white of the egg should not be used, as the
bread or cracker crumbs will not adhere to the
flesh so well.</p>

<p>They may be dressed as above, and fried in the
hot lard and butter, without the egg and crumbs.</p>


<h3>ROAST TURKEY.</h3>

<p>115. Draw your turkey and prepare it for roasting
in the same manner as chickens. Make a
dressing of bread crumbs, some onions finely
minced, pepper, salt, and a little sweet marjoram,
with enough butter to make the crumbs adhere together;
rub the inside of the turkey with pepper
and salt, fill it with this dressing, season the outside
with salt and pepper, truss it firmly, put it on
the spit, dredge some flour over it, and place it before
the fire; baste it with butter while it is cooking.
Clean the giblets, boil them in very little
water, with some salt. When the turkey is done
take it up, pour the liquor the giblets were boiled
in, into the gravy which fell from it, chop up the
liver and put it in with some butter rolled in flour
to thicken the gravy, and more pepper and salt.
Serve it hot, with the gravy in a small tureen. A
very good dressing may be made of potatoes boiled
and finely mashed with onion, pepper and salt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
plenty of butter. Some fill the crop with bread
and the inside with potatoes.</p>


<h3>BOILED TURKEY.</h3>

<p>116. Draw your turkey, wash it clean, season it
with salt, but no pepper. Make a force-meat of some
cold veal finely minced, a little grated ham, pepper
and salt to the taste; add also a little grated nutmeg
and powdered mace. Fill the crop of the
turkey with this force-meat, tie or skewer it well.
Dredge flour over it, and wrap it in a napkin. Put
it in a large pot with plenty of water which has
been salted. Let it boil for about two hours, which
will cook it sufficiently, unless it be a very large one.</p>

<p>Take it out of the napkin, place it on a large
dish, garnish the edges of the dish with double
parsley, and serve with a rich oyster sauce in a
tureen.</p>


<h3>ROASTED DUCK, No. 1.</h3>

<p>117. Clean your ducks nicely, wash them and
wipe them dry. Rub them inside with pepper and
salt, and fill them with a dressing made of crumbs
of bread, two or three onions finely minced, some
pepper, salt, and butter enough to make the crumbs
adhere. Some use beaten egg in the dressing, but
it makes it tough and heavy. After having filled
the ducks truss them and put them on the spit;
baste them with butter whilst they are roasting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Wash the livers, first cut out the gall; with a
sharp knife open the gizzards by cutting an incision
round them, but not so deep as to cut the
inner skin; then with your fingers tear them open.
Pour boiling water on the feet and skin them; cut
off the toes, and crack the leg in half, wash all these,
and stew them in very little water, with pepper
and salt. When the ducks are done, add the liquor
the giblets were boiled in to the gravy, which has
dropped from them, and thicken it with a little
butter rolled in flour. Serve the liver on the dish
with the ducks.</p>


<h3>ROAST DUCK, No. 2.</h3>

<p>118. Prepare the ducks as directed above, and
for the filling, mince two onions finely, add some
pepper, salt, and a table spoonful of powdered sage,
with an ounce of butter and some beaten egg.</p>

<p>Rub the inside of the ducks with pepper and salt,
put in the dressing, truss them, and put them on
the spit. For the gravy, proceed as directed above.</p>


<h3>ROAST GOOSE.</h3>

<p>119. Clean your goose, wash it, and wipe it
dry, then season it with pepper and salt both inside
and out. Make a dressing of bread crumbs,
pepper, salt, butter, a little sweet marjoram, and
some onions finely minced. Fill the goose with
this dressing, truss it firmly, and put it on the spit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Whilst it is roasting, baste it with butter, and be
careful not to let it burn.</p>

<p>Clean the giblets, put them on in a stew-pan, with
very little water, some salt and pepper, and boil them.
Add the liquor they were boiled in to the gravy
which dripped from the goose. Thicken it with some
butter rolled in flour, let it boil a few minutes; add
more pepper and salt, if necessary. Pour this
gravy in the boat, and serve it with the goose.
Some prefer a little sage added to the dressing in
place of the sweet marjoram.</p>

<p>A very good dressing for roast goose is to substitute
potatoes boiled and finely mashed instead
of the bread crumbs, then add the pepper, salt,
onions, and sweet marjoram as before.</p>


<h3>GIBLET PIE.</h3>

<p>120. Wash and clean your giblets, put them in
a stew-pan, season with pepper, salt, and a little
butter rolled in flour, cover them with water, stew
them till they are very tender. Line the sides of
your pie dish with paste, put in the giblets, and if
the gravy is not quite thick enough add a little
more butter rolled in flour. Let it boil once, pour
in the gravy, put on the top crust, leaving an
opening in the centre of it in the form of a square;
ornament this with leaves of the paste. Set the
pie in the oven, and when the crust is done take
it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>


<h3>ROAST CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>121. Clean your chickens, wash them and wipe
them dry; season them inside with pepper and salt,
make a dressing of bread crumbs, some minced
onion, pepper, salt, and as much butter as will hold
the crumbs together. Fill your chickens with this
dressing, skewer them well and season them on the
outside with salt and pepper; put them on the spit,
dredge a little flour over, and baste them with butter
whilst they are roasting.</p>

<p>Boil the gizzards and livers in very little water,
take out the liver, chop it up fine, and add it to the
water it was boiled in, with a little salt; stir into
this all the gravy which dripped from the chickens,
and thicken it with some butter rolled in flour.</p>

<p>Partridges are roasted in the same way.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_122" id="Article_122">CHICKEN PIE.</a></h3>

<p>122. Cut your chickens in pieces, wash them,
and put them in a stew-pan with salt and pepper,
and water enough to nearly cover them. To each
one, rub one ounce of butter in flour, and add it to
the gravy when the chickens are done; let it boil a
few minutes. Make a rich paste, line the sides of
your pie dish, put in the chickens and half the
gravy, cover the pie with the paste; leave an opening
in the centre, and ornament the top with paste
cut in flowers, or bars twisted and laid across the
centre. When the crust is done take out the pie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
pour in the remainder of the gravy, and send it to
the table in the dish it is baked in. If all the gravy
is put in at once it will be apt to boil over the top
and disfigure the lid of the pie.</p>

<p>Partridge pies are made in the same manner.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN POT PIE.</h3>

<p>123. Cut your chickens in pieces, wash them
and dry them in a clean napkin; season with salt
and pepper. Line the sides of the pot with paste,
put in the pieces of chicken, and between every
layer of chicken put a piece of butter rolled in flour,
with squares of the paste if you choose; pour in
enough cold water to cover it, and put on a lid of
the paste; leave an opening in the centre of the top
crust; cover the pot, place it in front of the fire
with a few coals under it. Turn the pot frequently
that the crust may be evenly browned all around.
When it is done, if the gravy should not be thick
enough, add a little more flour mixed with butter.
Dish it by putting the top crust on the sides of the
dish, lay the chicken in the centre, and place the
brown crust on the top. Serve the gravy in a
sauce boat.</p>


<h3>BROILED CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>124. Split them down the back, wash them
nicely and wipe them dry. Heat your gridiron,
grease the bars, and put your chickens over clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
coals. Broil them nicely, be careful not to burn the
legs and wings. When done season them with
pepper, salt, and a large piece of butter. Send
them to the table hot.</p>

<p>Partridges, pheasants and pigeons are broiled in
the same way.</p>


<h3>FRIED CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>125. Wash your chickens, cut them in pieces, season
them with pepper and salt. Have in a pan some
hot butter and lard mixed; dust some flour over
each piece, and fry them slowly till of a bright
brown on both sides; take them up, put a little
water in the pan, add some butter rolled in flour to
thicken the gravy, and more pepper and salt if required.
Young spring chickens are only suitable
for frying.</p>


<h3>BOILED CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>126. Clean and wash your chickens, put them
in a pot with boiling water enough to cover them;
if the water should boil away add more, as the
skin will be discolored if not covered with water.
Put enough salt in the water to season the chickens
sufficiently when they are done; tie some tape
around them to keep them in their proper shape;
when they are tender take them up and serve them
with rich egg sauce.</p>

<p>Boiled chickens are frequently stuffed with bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, a little onion,
finely chopped, and some butter; fill the chickens
with this dressing, truss them and tie tape around
them to preserve their shape. But it is preferable
to boil chickens without the filling, as it soaks the
water and becomes very insipid.</p>


<h3>STEWED CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>
127. One pair of large chickens,<br />
Two tea spoonsful of salt,<br />
One tea spoonful of pepper,<br />
Eight tea spoonsful of flour,<br />
One pint of water.<br />
</p>

<p>Cut up the chickens, separate the thighs from
the lower part of the leg, cut the breast in six
parts, cut the wings in two parts, and the back in
four pieces, put them into a stew-pan with the pepper,
salt and flour, stir all well together, and then
add the water. Let them stew till perfectly tender.
If the gravy should not be thick enough add
a little flour mixed with water. Fat chickens require
no butter, but early fall chickens would need
a quarter of a pound to make a rich gravy.</p>


<h3>BROWN FRICASSEE.</h3>

<p>128. Cut your chicken in pieces, wash it and wipe
it dry; it must be young, an old one would not be
tender when cooked in this manner; season it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
pepper and salt. Put in your pan some lard or
beef dripping, let it get hot, dredge some flour over
your chicken and fry it of a handsome brown, turn
each piece so as to have both sides done alike.
Take the pieces out, put them on a dish, put a little
water in the pan with the gravy, and a piece of
butter rolled in brown flour to thicken it. Let it
boil once and pour it over the chicken.</p>


<h3>WHITE FRICASSEED CHICKEN.</h3>

<p>129. Cut up a chicken in pieces, wash it, and
season with pepper and salt, put it in a stew-pan
with a little water, and let it stew till nearly done;
then add a tea cupful of cream and some butter
rolled in flour to thicken the gravy. If not sufficiently
seasoned, add more pepper or salt as may
be required. If the chicken is fat very little butter
is necessary. Mace or nutmeg may be added if
you like spice.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN SALAD, No. 1.</h3>

<p>
130. A pair of large fowls,<br />
Four table spoonsful of mixed mustard, or
eight of French mustard&mdash;the French is preferable,<br />
Half a pint of vinegar,<br />
Half a pint of sweet oil,<br />
The yelks of ten hard boiled eggs,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>One tea spoonful of cayenne pepper,<br />
One tea spoonful of salt,<br />
Six large heads of celery.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the fowls in water which has been salted,
and stand them away to cool. Take off the skin,
cut the meat in small pieces about a quarter of an
inch square, then cut the white part of the celery
in very small pieces, put it in a colander, place the
colander in a pan of cold water in order to keep
the celery crisp.</p>

<p>Boil the eggs till the yelks are hard, which will
take twenty minutes; mash the yelks with the oil
until they are smooth, then add the vinegar, mustard,
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes before the chicken salad is
to be sent to the table, drain the celery, mix it
thoroughly with the chicken, and then pour the
dressing over it. Stir it well.</p>

<p>Cold veal or turkey is very good dressed in this way.</p>

<p>This receipt may be relied on as being particularly
nice. No. 2 is not quite so rich.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN SALAD, No. 2.</h3>

<p>
131. One pair of chickens,<br />
Eight eggs,<br />
Half a pint of oil,<br />
One gill of vinegar,<br />
Mustard, pepper, and salt to the taste,<br />
Six heads of celery.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the chickens in water with a little salt
When cold cut the meat in small pieces about a
quarter of an inch square; cut the celery in small
pieces and lay it in water; boil the eggs twenty
minutes, take out the yelks, mash them fine with
the oil, add the vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper.
Drain the celery, mix it with the chicken, and stir
the mixture of egg, vinegar, oil, &amp;c., well through
the chicken and celery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VEGETABLES" id="VEGETABLES">VEGETABLES.</a></h2>


<p>All vegetables are better to be freshly gathered,
when left to stand long, they lose much of their
flavor.</p>

<p>Late in the season, when turnips, parsnips, carrots,
&amp;c., begin to lose their sweetness, they may
be greatly improved by adding a tea spoonful or two
of sugar to the water they are boiled in.</p>


<h3>BOILED POTATOES, No. 1.</h3>

<p>132. Select the potatoes as nearly as possible
of the same size. Wash and boil them with the
skins on.</p>

<p>Throw a little salt in the water. When they

Or they may be mashed with butter, salt to the
taste, and milk or cream in the proportion of an
ounce of butter and half a gill of milk or cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to ten potatoes. They should be sent to the table
immediately, as they spoil if they stand after they

sides, and fry them in hot lard till they are of a
light brown.</p>


<h3>FRIED SWEET POTATOES.</h3>

<p>138. Boil some sweet potatoes till they are soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
enough to pass the prong of a fork through them.
Peel them, and when they get cold slice them.
Season with pepper and salt to the taste, dredge
flour over, and fry them in hot lard. They should
be of a fine light brown.</p>


<h3>ROASTED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>139. Wash them, and put them in a pan, in a
moderate oven. When they can be easily pierced
by a fork, they are done.</p>

<p>Serve them with the skins on. Those who reside
in the country, and have wood fires, may roast
them in the following manner. Sweep the hot
stone in front of the fire, place the potatoes on it,
and cover them with hot ashes. When they are

Six onions,<br />
Two ounces of butter,<br />
Pepper, salt, and vinegar to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the potatoes and the onions till they are soft;
the onions require about as long again as the potatoes.</p>

this dish.</p>


<h3>STEWED TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>144. If they are not very ripe, pour boiling
water over them, and let them stand a few minutes,
the skin will peel off very easily.</p>

<p>Then cut them up, put them in a stew-pan without
any water, and cook them till they are soft.
If they prove too juicy, dip some of the water out
and mash them fine. Season with butter, cayenne
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>They may be thickened with bread crumbs or

<p class="space-remove center">(<em>For roast Pig.</em>)</p>

<p>215. Put on the feet and liver of the pig with
just enough water to cover them, with a little salt.
Let them stew slowly, when the feet are tender
take them up, cut them in two or three pieces, but
do not take out the bones; chop the liver, return it
and the feet to the liquor they were boiled in; set
the stew-pan over the fire, add pepper, salt and
sweet-marjoram to the taste. Roll a piece of butter
in flour, and stir in to thicken the gravy, add

stir them well and serve them.</p>

<p>Tomatoes may be dressed as cucumbers, and
make a very good sauce for cold meat.</p>


<h3>OYSTER SAUCE.</h3>

<p>218. Cut off the beards and boil them with the
liquor with a bit of mace and lemon peel. In the
mean time throw the oysters in cold water and
then drain them; strain the spice from the liquor,

ounces of butter rolled in flour, and a gill of rich
milk or cream. Let it boil once, squeeze in a little
lemon juice, and serve it hot.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE.</h3>

<p>219. Wash a dozen tomatoes, cut them in
pieces but do not skin them. Put them in a stew-pan

soft, pass them through a sieve to remove the skins
and spice; put them back in the stew-pan, let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
boil five minutes, then add two ounces of butter
rolled in half a tea spoonful of flour, let it boil
once, then serve it.</p>

<h2><a name="PICKLES" id="PICKLES">PICKLES.</a></h2>


<p>Pickles should always be done in the very best
cider or wine vinegar, as the chemical preparations
known by the name of vinegar soften the pickles,
besides being very injurious to the stomach.</p>

<p>Stone or glass jars are the best for keeping
pickles, which should be always completely covered
with vinegar. When they are first put into the
jars they require attention for a day or two, to keep
them filled up, as the vinegar sinks in the jar, or is
imbibed by the pickles.</p>


<h3>PICKLED PEPPERS.</h3>

<p>220. If you would prefer your peppers less
pungent, cut an opening in the top of the pepper,
and take out half the seeds.</p>

<p>Lay them for two weeks in salt and water which
will bear an egg. Be careful to keep them covered
with the brine. Put a board over them to keep
them under the salt and water, and take off the
scum as it rises.</p>

<p>If they are not yellow at the end of two weeks,
let them remain in the brine a little longer.</p>

<p>When yellow take them out, wash them, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
them in a kettle with cold water&mdash;cover the top
with leaves&mdash;place them near the fire, let them get
hot, but do not permit them to simmer. When
they are greened in this manner, take them out,
drain them, place them in your jars, and pour cold
spiced vinegar over them.</p>

<p>If you wish to stuff them, chop some cabbage
very fine, season it highly with mace, cinnamon,
cloves, and mustard seed&mdash;stuff the peppers with
this preparation, and tie a thread round each one
to keep the stuffing in.</p>


<h3>PICKLED MUSHROOMS, No. 1.</h3>

<p>221. Choose button mushrooms; wipe them
well with a clean cloth. Sprinkle a little salt over
them, and put them in a stew-pan, with some pieces
of mace and whole pepper corns. Simmer them
slowly till all the juice is out of them. Shake
them frequently. Let them simmer very gradually
till all the liquor is dried up, but be careful not to
let the mushrooms get dry. When the juice has
all evaporated, pour over them as much cold vinegar
as will cover them, let them get hot, and put
them in jars. When cold, cover them closely.</p>


<h3>PICKLED MUSHROOMS, No. 2.</h3>

<p>222. Select the <em>button</em> mushrooms, that is, those
which are not fully blown. Cut off the ends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the stems, scrape them, peel the tops, and wipe
them on a clean cloth.</p>

<p>Put them into a stew-pan, with just enough water
to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the
pan. Shake them occasionally, to prevent them
from burning.</p>

<p>As soon as they are tender, pour over them some
boiling vinegar, seasoned with mace, cloves, whole
grains of pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>When cool, bottle them, and seal the corks.</p>


<h3>PICKLED ONIONS.</h3>

<p>223. Choose small white onions, peel them,
and throw a few at a time in a pan of boiling salt
and water; as soon as they look clear take them
out carefully, and place them on a sieve to dry;
then put in more, and so on, till all are cooked.
When they are cold, put them in jars, and pour
spiced vinegar over them.</p>

<p>To each quart of the vinegar, put one table
spoonful of whole allspice, half a table spoonful of
pepper grains, three or four small pieces of mace,
half a dozen cloves, and a table spoonful of mustard
seed. Boil all these spices in the vinegar,
and pour it, boiling hot, over the pickles.</p>


<h3>PICKLED EGGS.</h3>

<p>224. Boil some eggs hard; take off the shells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
put them into a jar, and cover them with cold
vinegar.</p>


<h3>CHOW CHOW.</h3>

<p>
225. Three cabbages,<br />
Twenty-five peppers,<br />
Half a pint of mustard seed,<br />
Three sticks of horse-radish, chipped.<br />
</p>

<p>Cut the cabbages as for slaw; chop the peppers
very fine. Put in a jar a layer of cabbage, a very
little salt, then a layer of peppers, sprinkle over
this some horse-radish and mustard seed, and so on,
till all is in, then fill up the jars with cold vinegar,
in every quart of which dissolve two ounces of
sugar.</p>

<p>This is very good with hot or cold meat.</p>


<h3>PICKLED WALNUTS.</h3>

<p>226. Rub your walnuts well with a coarse
towel, and lay them for two weeks in salt and water
strong enough to float an egg.</p>

<p>Drain them, and put them in your kettle, with
fresh water enough to cover them, and let them
stand twelve hours, where they will keep hot, but
not boil.</p>

<p>To one hundred walnuts take one gallon of the
best vinegar, one ounce of pepper, one ounce of
cloves, half an ounce of mace, half an ounce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
nutmeg, four ounces of ginger. Break the ginger
and nutmegs in pieces, bruise the pepper a little,
and put the spices into the vinegar just before it
boils. Let it boil five minutes; pour it out, cover
it closely, and stand it away to get cold.</p>

<p>Place the walnuts in your jars, and strew over
them about four ounces of mustard seed, pounded
and sifted, then pour the spiced vinegar over and
cover them closely.</p>


<h3>PICKLED PEACHES.</h3>

<p>227. Select ripe cling-stone peaches. To one
gallon of good vinegar add four pounds of brown
sugar; boil this for a few minutes, and take off
any scum which may rise. Rub the peaches with
a flannel cloth, to remove the down, and stick a
clove in each; put them in glass or stone jars, and
pour the liquor upon them boiling hot. When cold,
cover the jars and let them stand in a cool place
for a week or ten days, then pour off the liquor
and boil it as before, after which return it, boiling,
to the peaches, which should be carefully covered
and stored away for future use.</p>

<p>If your peaches are very hard, boil them in water
till tender, before you pickle them, and they will
be fit for use almost immediately.</p>


<h3>PICKLED BEANS.</h3>

<p>228. String-beans, or French beans, are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
kind used for pickling. Take off the strings but do
not break the beans; put them in strong salt and
water for three or four days; cover them with a
board and weight so as to keep them under the
water. Then take them out, wash them, and put
them in a preserving kettle with hot water enough
to cover them, and put leaves or a cloth over them
to keep in the steam. When they are green take
them out, drain them and put them in jars; pour
hot vinegar over them, with any kind of spice you
may like best, and a small piece of alum in each jar.</p>

<p>Radish pods are pickled in the same way.</p>


<h3>PICKLED MANGOES.</h3>

<p>229. Cut your mangoes in half, take out all the
seeds, tie them together with coarse thread, and
lay them in strong salt and water for three or four
days. Then wash and drain them, put them into
a kettle with vine or cabbage leaves over the top,
or they may be covered with a clean coarse cloth;
pour in hot water enough to cover them, and let
them stand near the fire to keep hot. When they
are green take them out, untie them, turn the cut
side down and drain them. Cut some horse-radish
in fine slips, and mix with it some mace, cloves,
pepper, allspice and mustard seed; fill your mangoes
with this, and if you like it add a clove of
garlic to each one, place the two sides together and
tie them again. Put them in jars and cover them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with vinegar. Cut off the threads before they are
sent to the table.</p>


<h3>PICKLED CUCUMBERS.</h3>

<p>230. Select the small sized cucumbers for pickling.
They should be free from bruises and of a
fine green color, for if they are old and yellow when
picked from the vines they will never be green
when they are pickled. Wash your cucumbers in
cold water to remove all the sand and grit, put
them in your pickling tub, make a brine of salt and
water strong enough to float an egg. Pour enough
of this brine over the cucumbers to cover them;
spread over the top a coarse cloth and over this
put the lid of the tub, which should be just large
enough to fit inside and slip down so as to press
on the cucumbers, put a weight on the lid to keep
it in its place. Let them stand in the salt and
water till they are perfectly yellow, which will be
in about nine days. When they are quite yellow
take them out, wash them in cold water and examine
each one separately; if you should find any
soft or bruised reject them, as they would be likely
to spoil the others. Put them into a preserving
kettle, cover them with hot water and vine or cabbage
leaves, or if you have no leaves a clean coarse
towel will answer as well. Put a plate over the
top and stand them where they will keep hot, but
not simmer, as that would ruin them. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
are perfectly green take them out of the water,
drain them, and put in your jars first a layer of
cucumbers, then a tea spoonful of whole allspice,
half a dozen cloves, some strips of horse-radish, and
half a tea spoonful of mustard seed, then more cucumbers,
and so on till the jar is full. Pour in as
much good vinegar as will cover them, with a tea
spoonful of pulverized alum to each jar. In a day
or two examine them, and fill up the jars with
vinegar if the pickles have absorbed it so as to
leave the top ones uncovered.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to pickle all your cucumbers
at once, (and they are much better when they are
freshly pickled,) take them out of the salt and
water, wash and drain them. Put the brine over
the fire, boil and skim it; let it stand to get cold;
wash the pickle tub, wipe it dry, put the cucumbers
into it; examine each one that no specked
ones may be put in the tub, pour the cold brine
over them, wash the cloth and lid of the tub and
replace them as before. Cucumbers will keep in
this way all winter. They may be pickled a few
at a time whenever they are wanted. They must
be soaked twenty-four hours in cold water before
they are pickled; if they are so long in salt and
water they imbibe too much salt to green them
without soaking.</p>

<p>Gherkins are done in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>


<h3>PICKLED BEETS.</h3>

<p>231. Boil your beets till tender, but not quite
soft. To four large beets boil three eggs hard, remove
the shells; when the beets are done take off
the skin by laying them for a few minutes in cold
water and then stripping it off; slice them a quarter
of an inch thick, put the eggs at the bottom,
and then put in the beets with a little salt. Pour
on cold vinegar enough to cover them. The eggs
imbibe the color of the beets, and look beautiful
on the table.</p>


<h3>PICKLED CHERRIES.</h3>

<p>232. Pick over your cherries, remove all the
specked ones. Put them into a jar, and pour over
them as much hot vinegar and sugar as will cover
them; to each gallon of vinegar allow four pounds
of sugar. Boil and skim it and pour it hot over
the fruit. Let it stand a week, then pour off the
vinegar and boil it as before, pour it hot over the
cherries the second time. As soon as they are cold
tie them closely.</p>


<h3>TOMATO CATSUP, No. 1.</h3>

<p>233. Boil half a bushel of tomatoes until they
are soft, squeeze them through a fine wire sieve
and add&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>One quart of vinegar,<br />
Half a pint of salt,<br />
One ounce of cloves,<br />
Two ounces of <em>whole</em> allspice,<br />
Two ounces of ground cayenne pepper,<br />
A dessert spoonful of ground black pepper,<br />
Two heads of garlic skinned and separated.<br />
</p>

<p>Mix the whole together and boil three hours;
bottle without straining it.</p>

<p>On the top of each bottle pour a table spoonful
of sweet oil, cork them closely and seal them. The
sweet oil by excluding the air tends to preserve the
catsup.</p>


<h3>TOMATO CATSUP, No, 2.</h3>

<p>234. Slice the tomatoes, put a layer in a deep
vessel, and sprinkle over some salt; then another
layer of tomatoes and salt till all are in. Stand
them in the sun for two or three days, when they
are soft pass them through a sieve, and put the
pulp, thus drained out, over the fire to boil. Add
cayenne pepper, whole black pepper, mace, cloves,
allspice, and a little race ginger if you like; let it
boil till it is thick, add a clove of garlic; by tasting
it you can judge if it is seasoned to your taste.
When cold, bottle it off; put a table spoonful of
sweet oil on the top of each bottle, and seal the
corks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>


<h3>MUSHROOM CATSUP.</h3>

<p>235. Procure fresh mushrooms, pick them carefully,
wipe them clean, and put a layer in the bottom
of a pan, sprinkle over some salt, then another
layer of mushrooms and more salt until all are in;
cover the pan and let them stand two days, mash
them well and strain them through a hair sieve.
To each quart of the pulp add one ounce and a
half of whole black pepper, half an ounce of whole
allspice, and a few blades of mace. Boil it till reduced
to two-thirds the original quantity. When
done pour it in a pan and stand it away till the
next day, then pass it through a hair sieve and bottle
it for use. Put it in small bottles, on the top
of each pour a table spoonful of sweet oil to exclude
the air. Cork them closely and rosin the corks.</p>


<h3>WALNUT CATSUP.</h3>

<p>236. When your pickled walnuts are soft, mash
them through the vinegar which covers them, strain
it and boil it to a proper thickness. Bottle it, put
a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bottle,
and cork them tightly; seal the corks and it
will keep for several years.</p>

<p>This catsup is excellent.</p>


<h3>PICKLED NASTURTIUMS.</h3>

<p>237. Cut the green seeds of the nasturtiums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with a piece of the stem to each. Put them in a
jar of cold vinegar.</p>


<h3>PICKLED TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>238. Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, prick
them with a large needle, and lay them in strong
salt and water eight days. Then take them out of
the brine and lay them in vinegar and water for
twenty-four hours. Scald a dozen small onions in
vinegar and stand the whole away to get cold.
Drain the tomatoes and add them to the cold
onions and vinegar, with two wine-glasses of mustard-seed
and an ounce of cloves.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PASTRY" id="PASTRY">PASTRY.</a></h2>


<p>The flour for pastry should be of the whitest and
finest quality. It should be mixed with a broad
knife, as the moisture and warmth of the hand
makes it heavy.</p>

<p>The butter should be of the best quality, as if it
is a little rancid it will taste. To make puff paste
it should have all the salt washed out of it.</p>

<p>Iron, or block tin plates are the best for baking
pastry.</p>

<p>Always use cold water (in summer iced water)
to mix pastry, and if it cannot be baked immediately,
set it away in a cool place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>


<h3>PUFF-PASTE.</h3>

<p>
239. One pound of butter,<br />
One pound of flour.<br />

<p>Wash your butter in cold water to extract all
the salt; work it well with a broad wooden spoon
in order to get out all the water. Lay it between
clean napkins, put it in a tin pan or plate, set it on
the ice to get hard, but do not let it freeze. Sift
your flour in a pan, cut the butter in four equal
parts, cut one-fourth in very small pieces in the
flour, but do not touch it, as the warmth of your
hands will make the paste heavy. Add to the flour
as much <em>cold</em> water as will make it a stiff dough.
Turn it out on your pie-board, roll it gently into
sheets, cut one-third of the remainder of the butter
into small pieces, and lay over it, sprinkle on a <em>very</em>
little flour, fold it over, roll it out again, cut one-half
of the butter which is left in small pieces and
lay on, put on a little flour, and fold it as before,
roll it out again, and put on the remainder of the
butter. It should now be set on the ice, but should
not come in contact with it. When it is perfectly
cold, roll it out in a sheet thinner in the centre
than at the edges of your pie, cut it with a <em>very
sharp</em> knife the size you wish it. Fill with whatever
you choose, and bake in a tolerably quick
oven.</p>

One pint of milk,<br />
Six eggs,<br />
Two ounces of butter,<br />
Half a pint of cream,<br />
A quarter of a pound of dried currants,<br />
Sugar and nutmeg to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>After the bread is soaked in the milk, which
should be warm, mash it very smooth and add the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
butter while it is hot. Beat the eggs very light,
the yelks first, and stir them into the bread and
milk, then add the cream, sugar, nutmeg and fruit.
Lastly have the whites whisked to a dry froth;
stir them gently into the mixture; butter your cups,
half fill them with the batter, and bake them in a
tolerably hot oven. Serve with pudding sauce.</p>


<h3>COLLEGE PUDDING.</h3>

<p>
295. Four eggs,<br />
One pint of milk,<br />
A little salt,<br />
Flour to make a rather thin batter,<br />
One dessert spoonful of dissolved carbonate of ammonia.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the yelks of the eggs very light, add the
salt, milk and flour. The batter must not be thick.
Beat the whole very hard for ten or fifteen minutes.
Then stir in gently the whites of the egg, which
should have been whisked very dry. Do not beat
the batter after the whites are in, only stir it sufficiently
to incorporate them with it. Lastly add
the ammonia. Butter well a cake mould or iron
pan, pour in the mixture and bake it in an oven
about as hot as for bread.</p>

<p>This pudding is very nice with wine or lemon
sauce. Cream sauce may be served with it if preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>


<h3>BLANC MANGE.</h3>

<p>
296. One pint of milk,<br />
One pint of cream,<br />
One ounce of isinglass,<br />
The grated rind and juice of one lemon,<br />
Sugar to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the milk and pour it whilst hot over the
isinglass, let it stand near the fire until it is perfectly
dissolved, then strain it through a flannel
jelly bag into the pint of cream, to which add the
grated rind and juice of one lemon, and sugar to
the taste. Let the whole boil once; take it off the
fire, strain it again through your jelly bag, and
pour it in moulds. Set it in a cool place.</p>


<h3>CLEAR BLANC MANGE.</h3>

<p>297. Boil four calves' feet in three quarts of
water until the water is reduced to one quart, then
strain it through a flannel jelly bag and stand it
away to cool. When it is perfectly cold scrape off
all the fat, which will be congealed in a cake on
the top; after you have scraped all off as clean as
you can get it, take a piece of clean damp sponge,
or soft cloth a little damp, and wipe the top of the
jelly and the inner edge of the vessel which contains
it, lest any of the grease should be combined
with the jelly when it is melted, as it would destroy
its transparency. Break the jelly in pieces, put it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in a preserving pan, add to it one pound of pulverized
white sugar, half an ounce of bitter almonds
pounded in a mortar with a little rose-water; put
the almonds in the mortar one at a time, so as to
pound them very finely, they should be like cream
when done; strain them and add them to the jelly
with a table spoonful of rose-water. Place the
preserving pan in a vessel of boiling water, let it
stand till it gets <em>very hot</em>, but do not let it boil.
Strain it through the jelly bag several times, and
when perfectly clear pour it in moulds; wet them
inside first to prevent the jelly from adhering to
them, and stand them in a cold place. When you
strain the jelly do not squeeze the bag, as by that
means you force the sediment through it; and by no
means wash it, as it is impossible to wring it perfectly
dry, and consequently the jelly will be thinned;
scrape it on the inside as clean as you can
each time.</p>


<h3>CHARLOTTE DE RUSSE.</h3>

<p>298. Get a sponge cake which has been baked
in a mould, and weighing about two pounds or little
more. Place this in the centre of a deep china

have been baked the day before; let it stand till it
has absorbed as much of the wine as it will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
up, then make a custard according to the following
directions: Put over the fire three half-pints of
milk, well sweetened and flavored with lemon or
vanilla, and as soon as it is ready to boil stir in <em>very</em>
gradually the yelks of six eggs which should have
been well beaten. As soon as the milk and egg
begins to bubble a little at the edges, take it off the
fire. When the custard is lukewarm pour it round
the cake in the dish; whisk the whites of the eggs
to a stiff, dry froth, sweeten them with powdered
white sugar and flavor with essence of lemon or
lemon juice. Pile the whites on the top of the cake
and serve it immediately.</p>


<h3>PEACH CHARLOTTE.</h3>

<p>299. Line the bottom and sides of a dish with

it in a pan, place the pan in a vessel of water, put
it in the oven, and as soon as the custard is thick,
set it away to cool. With a silver spoon lay the
custard over the cake. Take half a pint of cream,
flavor it with wine and white sugar, whip it to a
froth, and as the froth rises, take it off carefully
and lay it on the custard.</p>

<p>The wine may be dispensed with, and the charlotte
be very nice, if made according to the above
directions.</p>


<h3>CHERRY CHARLOTTE.</h3>

<p>301. Stone and stew some morella cherries; to
each pound of cherries add three-quarters of a

taste, pour it into a bowl, and stand it away to
cool.</p>

<p>Grate nutmeg on the top.</p>

much rice flour as will make it as thick as a stiff
batter.</p>

<p>Add the butter and sugar, turn it out in cups,
and stand it away to get cold.</p>

<p>Serve it with cream and nutmeg if preferred.</p>

<p>It would be better to place the vessel in which
the milk is to be boiled in a pan of hot water,
which will prevent the milk from burning, should
the fire be hot.</p>

instead of paste. Boil them until the apple is soft.</p>

<p>They should be tied in dumpling cloths.</p>


<h3>GLAZED CURRANTS.</h3>

wash them by dipping them in a bowl of cold water,
and drain them dry; have ready the whites of

fruit. Dip them one at a time in a vessel of cold
water and place them on a sieve to dry. Beat the
whites of two or three eggs, according to the quantity
of fruit. The egg should be beaten very little
or it will not adhere to the fruit, dip the berries in
the egg one at a time, place them on a sieve so as
not to touch each other, and sift powdered white
sugar over them. They are very ornamental to a
dessert table. Bunches of grapes, oranges peeled
and quartered, or any small fruit may be done in
the same manner.</p>

with white sugar; stir into it a table spoonful of
wine in which a rennet has been soaked; if this
does not flavor the milk sufficiently add some more
wine without the rennet; or, if the use of wine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
an objection, the rennet may be soaked in water.
In warm weather one hour before it is to be served
will be the proper time to make it, as it is not good
if the curd is hard. As soon as the rennet is put
into the milk stir it and pour it in cups to coagulate.
Or you may serve it in a glass bowl. It is
to be eaten with cream.</p>

<h2><a name="CAKES" id="CAKES">CAKES.</a></h2>


<p>In the manufacture of cakes it is of very great
importance that the materials be of a good quality.
It is better to make a plain cake of good materials
than a richer one of those of an inferior quality.</p>

<p>Eggs should be beaten in a broad pan until they
are <em>thick</em>, the yelks when whisked alone will be as
thick as batter. The whites when beaten by themselves,
should be dry and frothy, and appear full
of small white grains. For most cakes the fine
white pulverized sugar is best.</p>

<p>The flour should always be sifted, as it renders
the cakes lighter.</p>

<p>Never warm butter in the pan it is to be beaten
in, as it will be likely to make your cake heavy.
If the weather is cold let the butter stand in the
warm kitchen some time and it will be soft enough,
the action of beating the butter and sugar, and the
friction produced, softens the butter sufficiently.</p>

<p>Never beat cakes with your hand, the warmth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of the hand will make them streaked. Always use
a wooden ladle for butter and sugar, or batter, and
rods or switches for eggs.</p>


<h3>FRUIT OR PLUM CAKE, No. 1.</h3>

<p>
361. One pound of flour,<br />
One pound of butter,<br />

One pound of seeded raisins,<br />
One table spoonful of ground cinnamon,<br />
Two large nutmegs grated,<br />
One wine-glass of brandy,<br />
One wine-glass of wine.<br />
</p>

<p>Sift the flour, prepare the spice, wash, pick and
dry the currants, and seed the raisins.</p>

<p>With a wooden ladle beat the butter and sugar
together in a deep pan. When it is smooth and
light, beat the eggs. They should be whisked till
they are thick, as the lightness of the cake depends
in a great measure upon its being well beaten. Stir
in a portion of the egg and flour into the butter and
sugar, then a little more, till all is in and thoroughly
incorporated. Add the liquor and spice gradually,
and lastly the fruit, which must be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
floured. Beat the whole fifteen minutes. Butter
your pan, line it with two thicknesses of paper well
buttered, pour in the batter, and bake about five
hours.</p>

be added to suit the taste.</p>

A quarter of a pound of citron, cut in small slices,<br />
A tea spoonful of ground cinnamon,<br />
One nutmeg,<br />
A wine-glass of brandy, and one of wine.<br />
</p>

<p>Stir the butter and sugar together till it is very
smooth and light. Whisk the eggs till they are as
thick as batter, and stir them into the butter and
sugar alternately with the flour. Add the spice
and liquor very gradually, then the fruit, which
must be floured before it is put in, or it will settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
at the bottom of the cake and burn. Beat the
whole very hard for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>If it is baked in a tin or iron pan, butter the
pan, line the bottom and sides with very thick
white or brown paper, butter the paper well, and
pour in the mixture. Bake in a moderate oven
five hours.</p>

<p>As many object to the use of wine and brandy,
this cake may be finely flavored with a glass of
rose-water instead; or a little lemon juice and a
portion of the rind of the lemon grated in it.</p>

ten or fifteen minutes. Line your pans with two
thicknesses of stout white paper, which should be
well buttered, pour in the batter, and bake from
four to five hours.</p>

instead of the liquor. A wine-glass of rose-water
and as much lemon as to give it a taste.</p>

flour over it as will adhere to it.</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar together till it is perfectly
light and smooth. Whisk the yelks of the
eggs, without the whites, till they are very thick.
Stir the yelks into the butter and sugar. Add to
this the spice, liquor, and almonds. Beat it very
hard for five minutes. Whisk the whites till they
are dry and present a grained appearance.</p>

<p>Stir the whites and flour into the batter alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>nately,
but do not beat it after the whites are in;
just stir it sufficiently to mix the flour thoroughly.
Lastly stir in the fruit.</p>

<p>Line your pans with thick paper well buttered,
and pour in the mixture. Bake in a moderate
oven for three hours.</p>

<p>A wine glassful of rose-water may be used instead
of the wine and brandy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PRESERVES" id="PRESERVES">PRESERVES.</a></h2>


<p>Fruit for preserving should be carefully selected,
it should never be bruised, and always be of the
largest kind and fairest quality.</p>

<p>No sugar will make handsome preserves but the
purest white. It may be pulverized or in the loaf.
Besides, it is a mistaken idea that low priced sugars
are cheaper for preserves, for they must be boiled
much longer in order to collect the great amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of scum which arises on the syrup, consequently
the evaporation reduces the quantity.</p>

<p>Very little white of egg or isinglass is sufficient
to clarify an ordinary sized kettle of syrup. If too
much of either is used it froths on the surface and
is of no utility.</p>

<p>Preserves should always be boiled smartly; many
persons would be more successful with their preserving
if they would let their fruit boil fast. When
permitted to simmer it breaks in pieces.</p>

<p>All jellies and preserves should be put in the jars
while lukewarm, as the jelly or syrup, if it be
thick, breaks after it has become cold; the jars
should be left open till the next day.</p>

<p>Glass jars of a small size, or large tumblers, are
better for preserves than china, for should they not
keep well it can be detected immediately.</p>

<p>Each jar should have a piece of white paper cut
the size of the top, dip the paper in brandy or
spirits of wine and lay it on the preserves; then cut
another piece about a quarter of an inch larger
than the mouth of the jar; cut the edge of it in
slits nearly a quarter of an inch long; cover this
edge with paste, place the paper over the jar and
lap the edge over on the side of the jar, which may
easily be done, as the strips will lap one over the other.</p>

<p>Each jar should have the name of the contents
written on the cover.</p>

<p>Preserves should be kept in a cool dry place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>


<h3>CALF'S FOOT JELLY.</h3>

<p>421. To one set of feet pour three quarts of
water. Let it boil till reduced to one half, then
strain the liquor through a jelly bag and stand it
away to get cold. When it is cold scrape off the
cake of fat, and in order to cleanse the jelly from all
the grease wipe the surface with a damp spunge, also
the sides of the vessel which contains it. Cut up
the jelly and put it in your preserving kettle, but be
careful not to take the sediment which settles at the
bottom. To each pint of this jelly add half a pound
of the very best white sugar, and a quarter of an
ounce of Russian isinglass dissolved in warm water,
one tea cupful of Madeira wine, and the juice and
rind of two lemons. When the sugar is dissolved
set the kettle over the fire and boil it for twenty
minutes. Then pour it into your jelly bag and let
it drip but do not squeeze the bag. As soon as it
has all dripped through turn the bag, scrape it well
but do not wash it, and strain your jelly again.
Repeat this till it is perfectly clear. Pour it in the
moulds while it is warm and let them stand open
till the jelly is cold. When you wish to turn it out of
the moulds wring a napkin out of hot water and wrap
it round the moulds for a minute or two, then turn
the moulds upside down, and the jelly will turn out.</p>


<h3>FOX GRAPE JELLY.</h3>

<p>422. Take green fox grapes, wash them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
put them in a preserving kettle with just water
enough to pulp them. When they are tender mash
and strain them through a sieve, to free them from
the seeds and skin. To each pint of the pulp add
a pound of the best white sugar, and a piece of
isinglass about an inch square, dissolved in warm
water. When the sugar has dissolved stir it well,
and place the kettle over the fire. Let it boil fifteen
or twenty minutes, then try it by dropping a
little in a glass of cold water, if it falls to the bottom
without mixing with the water the jelly is done.
Pass it through a jelly bag, pour it into your glasses
while warm, and let it stand till the next day before
the glasses are pasted.</p>


<h3>CRANBERRY JELLY, No. 1.</h3>

<p>423. Pick and wash your cranberries, which
should be very ripe, and put them over the fire
with half a pint of water to each quart of cranberries.
Stew them till they are soft, then mash them
and strain the juice through a jelly bag; to each
pint of juice add one pound of loaf or pulverized
white sugar, with some isinglass, in the proportion
of half an ounce to two quarts of juice. Dissolve
the isinglass in as much warm water as will cover
it; when perfectly dissolved, which will require a
couple of hours, pour it in with the sugar and juice.
When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fire, and boil and skim it till a jelly is formed,
which you can tell by dropping a little in a glass of
cold water. If it falls to the bottom without mingling
with the water the jelly is done. When it is
lukewarm pour it in glasses and let them stand till
the following day, then cover them with brandy
paper and paste them closely.</p>


<h3>CRANBERRY JELLY, No. 2.</h3>

<p>424. Dissolve one ounce of Russian isinglass in
three half-pints of warm water. Strain it through
your flannel jelly-bag. Add to this three pints of
cranberry juice with four pounds of sugar; boil and
skim it. As soon as the scum has ceased to rise
strain it and put it in moulds. The sugar should
be of the best quality.</p>


<h3>ORANGE JELLY.</h3>

<p>425. Squeeze the juice from the oranges, and
to every pint of the juice add a pound of sugar and
a quarter of an ounce of dissolved isinglass. The
Russian isinglass is the kind to use for this purpose.
Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, which
you may tell by letting a drop fall in a glass of cold
water, and if it falls to the bottom in a mass the
jelly is done. Or, take a little out in a spoon and
expose it to the cool air for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY JELLY.</h3>

<p>426. Stem the strawberries, put them in a pan,
and with a wooden spoon or potato masher rub
them fine. Put a sieve over a pan, and inside of
the sieve spread a piece of thin muslin; strain the
juice through this, and to a pint add one pound of
sugar, with a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved
in water to every five pounds of sugar.
When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the
fire and boil it till it is to a jelly. Pour it into
glasses while it is warm, and paste them when
cold.</p>


<h3>CURRANT JELLY.</h3>

<p>427. Mash your fruit with a wooden spoon,
and squeeze the juice through your jelly bag. To
every pint of juice allow a pound of white sugar.
When the sugar is dissolved, add a piece of isinglass
dissolved in warm water to clarify the jelly.
A quarter of an ounce of isinglass to five pints of
juice will be sufficient. Boil and skim it till a
jelly is formed; then take it off the fire and put it
in glasses while warm. The next day put brandy
paper over them and paste them.</p>

<p>Black currant jelly is made in the same way,
only it requires but three-quarters of a pound of
sugar to a pint of juice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>


<h3>QUINCE JELLY.</h3>

<p>428. Pare and core your quinces, and as you
pare them throw them into cold water. Put them
into a preserving kettle with water enough to cover
them, and let them boil till the fruit is tender.
Then put a sieve over a pan, pour the fruit and
water into it and let it drain, but do not mash the
fruit; strain the juice through the jelly bag. To
each pint of juice thus obtained add one pound of
loaf or pulverized white sugar; and to every five
pounds of sugar add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass
dissolved in hot water. When the sugar is
dissolved put it over the fire and boil and skim it
till a jelly is formed, which you can discover by
dropping a little in a glass of cold water: if it sinks
to the bottom without mingling with the water the
jelly is done. Pour it in your glasses when it is
lukewarm, and let them stand open till it is entirely
cold. Cover with brandy paper, and paste paper
over the top.</p>

<p>If you wish to have <em>light colored</em> jelly, never put
in the parings, as they always make it dark. A
jelly may be made of the parings and cores for
family use.</p>

<p>Apple jelly maybe made in the same manner as
the quince. The pulp of the apple, which is left
after the jelly is made, may be sweetened for pies.
The pulp of the quince may be made into marmalade
according to the following receipt:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>


<h3>QUINCE MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>429. To each pound of the pulp obtained according
to the above receipt for jelly, add one
pound of white sugar; boil the whole until it is
perfectly smooth. It must be stirred all the time
it is boiling. If you do not make jelly of your
quinces cut them up in small pieces, add a pound
of sugar to a pound of fruit, and as much water as
will dissolve the sugar; then boil it till it is a perfectly
smooth paste; stir it all the time.</p>


<h3>PEACH MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>430. Pare and cut up the peaches in small
pieces, and to a pound of fruit add a pound of
sugar. When the sugar is dissolved set it over the
fire and let it boil till it is a smooth paste. Stir it
all the time it is boiling. Put it in the jars while
warm and paste them over the next day.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED PEARS.</h3>

<p>431. Peel the pears, and if they are large, cut
each one in four pieces, and take out the core.</p>

<p>To a pound of fruit weigh a pound of sugar;
dissolve the sugar with just enough water to wet it,
add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved in
warm water to five pounds of sugar. When the
sugar is dissolved, make the syrup as directed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
preserved peaches, and cook the fruit in the same
manner.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED QUINCES.</h3>

<p>432. Pare and core the fruit, cut them in quarters,
and boil them in water <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'untill'">until</ins> tender. Weigh
the fruit and add a pound of sugar to each pound
of fruit. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle with
two wine-glasses of water to each pound of sugar,
and a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved in
warm water to every six pounds of fruit. When
the sugar is dissolved set it over the fire, boil and
skim it till no more scum rises. Then pour the
syrup in another vessel, wash the kettle so as to
free it from any scum which may adhere to it, pour
the jelly back in the kettle and put in the fruit.
Set it over a brisk fire and let it boil for about an
hour and a half, or until the fruit looks clear when
held towards the light. It should always boil hard
or the preserves will be dark colored. When it
appears translucent take it off the fire; take the
fruit out a piece at a time, and lay it on broad
dishes. Strain the syrup, and when it is lukewarm
put the fruit in your jars and pour the syrup over.
When cold cover with brandy paper and paste
them closely.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED PINE-APPLE.</h3>

<p>433. Scald the slices in water till tender; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
make a syrup of a pound of sugar to a pound of
fruit, and proceed as directed for quinces.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED PEACHES.</h3>

<p>434. Choose the white cling-stones, known by
the name of the "Heath peach." Insert the knife
at the stem and cut them longitudinally through to
the stone. Wring out the stones by placing one
hand on each half of the peach and suddenly give
each a turn in opposite directions; the fruit will
break in half, leaving the stone attached to one
side. With a pointed knife it may easily be extracted.
After the peaches have all been prepared
in this manner pare and weigh them. Then weigh
a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. Put the
sugar into a preserving kettle, and allow a gill of
water to each pound of sugar. Let the sugar stand
until it is perfectly dissolved before it is put on the
fire; to ten pounds of sugar add the half of the
white of an egg, well beaten, or a piece of Russian
isinglass, about an inch square, dissolved in two
table spoonsful of water. Set the kettle over the
fire, and as soon as the syrup begins to boil skim
it. When the scum has ceased to rise, take the
syrup off the fire, pour it into a pan, and wash the
kettle in order to prevent the scum which adheres
to the sides from boiling into the fruit. Now pour
the syrup back into the kettle, add the fruit to it,
and place it over a brisk fire, let the fruit boil fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
for about an hour and a quarter, or until it appears
translucent when held on a fork towards the light.
Then take your peaches out very carefully, a piece
at a time; place them on dishes so as merely to
touch. Pour the syrup in pans, and let it stand
until it is about lukewarm. Then put the fruit into
your jars and pour the syrup over; paste the jars
the next day.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED FRESH FIGS.</h3>

<p>435. Select the fruit when fully ripe, though
not soft, pick them carefully that they may not be
broken. Pour boiling water over them, and let
them simmer for five minutes.</p>

<p>Preserve them as other fruits.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED CITRON MELON.</h3>

<p>436. Cut off the hard rind of the melon (which
should be the <em>preserving</em> citron, not the green cantelope)
and cut it in pieces of any size and shape
you choose: the slices should be from a quarter to
half an inch thick. Weigh your fruit, and to every
pound add one of sugar. Put the sugar in a preserving
kettle with a gill of water to each pound
of sugar and some isinglass dissolved in warm
water; it will require a quarter of an ounce of
isinglass to every five pounds of fruit. When the
sugar is dissolved, put it over the fire and boil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
skim it. Then pour the syrup out of the kettle,
wash it and return the syrup to it. Now put in
the fruit, and set it over a brisk fire, where it will
boil rapidly. When the fruit appears translucent
when held up towards the light it is done. It will
take from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a
half to cook it.</p>

<p>Then take it out a piece at a time, spread it on
dishes, and strain the syrup in a pan. When the
syrup is lukewarm, put your fruit in the jars and
pour it over. Let them stand till next day, put
brandy paper over and paste them.</p>

<p>This fruit may be flavored with lemons sliced
and preserved with it. Do not peel the lemons, cut
them in thin slices, and cook them with the fruit.
To three pounds of fruit add one lemon. As the
citron makes a beautiful but tasteless preserve, it is
necessary to flavor it with lemon, orange, or some
other fruit. If, when it is a little cool, it should
not taste sufficiently of the lemon, a few drops of
the essence of lemon may be added.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED GREEN GAGES.</h3>

<p>437. Prepare the fruit by pricking each one
with a needle to prevent them from bursting.</p>

<p>Leave a portion of the stem on each, as it gives
small fruits a handsome appearance on the table.
Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to each pound
of fruit; and a gill of water to a pound of sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass, dissolved
in warm water, to every six pounds of sugar. When
the sugar is dissolved put it with the dissolved
isinglass over the fire, boil and skim it. Then
pour it out of the kettle, wash the kettle, put the
syrup back again, put in the fruit, and boil it till
by holding one towards the light it looks clear.
Take the gages out one at a time, strain the syrup;
put the fruit in jars, and pour the syrup over warm.
Paste them up the next day.</p>


<h3>PRESERVED PLUMS.</h3>

<p>438. These are preserved in the same manner
as gages, only they are skinned by pouring hot
water over them; the skins will peel off nicely
and leave the stems attached to the fruit.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>439. Put together equal weights of fruit and
sugar, mash all well, put it into a preserving kettle,
and boil it about twenty minutes. While it is
warm put it in jars, and paste it when cold.</p>


<h3>CHERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>440. This is better when made of fine morella
cherries. Wash the cherries and put them on to
stew with a gill of water to a pound of fruit. When
perfectly tender, pass them through a colander to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
extract the stones. To a pound of the pulp add a
pound of sugar, when the sugar is dissolved put it
over the fire, and boil it to a smooth paste.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>441. To a pound of fruit weigh a pound of
sugar; mash the fruit in a pan with a wooden
spoon; put the sugar to it, and boil it hard for fifteen
or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>To four pounds of raspberries you may add one
pound of ripe currants; they give the jam a fine
flavor and a pretty color.</p>

<p>Blackberry jam is made in the same manner;
only leave out the currants.</p>


<h3>GREEN GAGE JAM.</h3>

<p>442. Wash the fruit, and stew it with enough
water to keep them from scorching. Mash them,
and strain the pulp through a colander. To a pint
of pulp add a pound of sugar. When the sugar
is dissolved, boil it till it is a smooth mass.</p>

<p>Plum jam is made in the same way.</p>


<h3>PINE APPLE JAM.</h3>

<p>443. This is made like all other jams, only the
pine apple is grated.</p>


<h3>BRANDY GRAPES.</h3>

<p>444. Put some close bunches, when ripe, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a jar, first pricking each grape with a needle; strew
over them half their weight in pounded loaf sugar,
fill up with brandy, and tie them closely. They
look very handsome on the table.</p>


<h3>BRANDY PEACHES.</h3>

<p>445. Select the white cling-stone, known by
the name of the "Heath peach." Make a hot ley
of ashes and water, put in a few peaches at a time,
and let them remain about a minute and a half, or
until the skin will rub off with your finger. Take
them out and throw them in a vessel of cold water,
when all are done in this manner, rub off the skins
with a cloth, and throw them in another vessel of
cold water. Make a syrup of half a pound of sugar
to a pound of fruit. Prepare it in the same manner
as for preserves; put in your peaches, and let
them boil until they are sufficiently tender to be
easily pierced with a straw.</p>

<p>Take them out, and add to each pint of syrup a
quart of the <em>very best</em> white brandy, when the fruit
is cool put it in your jars, but leave plenty of room
to fill them with the syrup, as if packed too closely
they lose their shape.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="SICK" id="SICK">SICK.</a></h2>


<h3>SAGO MILK.</h3>

<p>446. Wash half an ounce of sago and soak it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in a tea cupful of cold water for an hour or more.
Drain it and add to it three gills of good milk; put
it over the fire and let it simmer until the sago is
entirely incorporated with the milk. Sweeten it
with white sugar. It may be flavored with vanilla,
lemon, or nutmeg, if allowed of by the physician.</p>


<h3>ORGEAT.</h3>

<p>447. Blanch one ounce of bitter, and two of
sweet almonds. Pound them in a mortar with a
little milk until they are to a paste. Rub gradually
into the pounded almond one tea cupful of
milk. Sweeten it to the taste and strain it.</p>

<p>It may be flavored with lemon.</p>


<h3>STEWED PRUNES.</h3>

<p>448. Pour enough boiling water over your
prunes to cover them, and stand them where they
will keep hot but not boil. They require six or
eight hours to cook. When they are perfectly
done add sugar to the taste of the patient.</p>


<h3>COCOA.</h3>

<p>449. Put three table spoonsful of cocoa to a
pint of water. Let it boil slowly for an hour.

<h3>EGG AND WINE.</h3>

<p>450. Beat the yelk of an egg very light, add
to it a glass of wine and sugar to the taste.</p>


<h3>SAGO PUDDING FOR INVALIDS.</h3>

<p>451. See tapioca pudding, <a href="#Article_452">No. 452</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_452" id="Article_452">TAPIOCA PUDDING.</a></h3>

<p>452. Pick and wash a table spoonful of tapioca,
pour over it a pint of warm milk, and stand it near
the fire for about one hour, but do not let it simmer.
Then boil it until it forms a semi-transparent
mucilage. Stand it aside to cool.</p>

<p>Beat two eggs, stir them into the mucilage with
as much sugar as will sweeten it, pour the mixture
in a pan and bake it slowly.</p>

<p>It may be eaten with sweet sauce.</p>

<p>Arrow-root and sago can be made in the same
manner, only the sago requires more soaking and
boiling than the tapioca.</p>


<h3>ARROW-ROOT PUDDING FOR INVALIDS.</h3>

<p>453. See tapioca pudding, <a href="#Article_452">No. 452</a>.</p>


<h3>PUDDING FOR THE CONVALESCENT.</h3>

<p>
454. One pint of milk,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>Two table spoonsful of flour,<br />
Three eggs,<br />
Sugar to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the eggs, add the sugar, then the milk and
flour by turns. Put the mixture in a bowl or pan,
place it in another pan of hot water, set it where it
will cook, and when a custard is formed set it off
to cool.</p>

<p>There should not be too much sugar for invalids
as it is apt to produce <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dispepsia'">dyspepsia</ins>.</p>


<h3>INDIAN GRUEL.</h3>

<p>455. Stir one table spoonful of Indian meal
mixed with a little cold water into a pint of boiling
water. Let it boil fifteen minutes and add salt to
the taste.</p>


<h3>EGG AND MILK.</h3>

<p>456. Take a fresh egg, break it in a saucer,
and with a three-pronged fork beat it until it is as
thick as batter. Have ready half a pint of new
milk sweetened with white sugar, stir the egg into
the milk, and serve it with a piece of sponge-cake
or slice of toast. It is considered very light, nourishing
food for an invalid.</p>

<p>Some prefer the yelk and white of the egg beaten
separately. The yelk should be beaten till it is
very light and thick, then pour it into the sweetened
milk; afterwards beat the white till it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
stand alone, and add gradually half a tea spoonful
of white sugar; pile the white on the top of the
milk and serve as before.</p>


<h3>SUGARED ORANGE.</h3>

<p>457. Select the lightest colored oranges for this
purpose, as they are more acid than the dark. Peel
off the rind and slice them, latitudinally or crosswise,
about the eighth of an inch in thickness.
Strew over them some powdered white sugar, in
the proportion of a tea spoonful of sugar to each
slice. Let them stand fifteen minutes. They are
very palatable in fevers, as they serve to cleanse
the mouth and keep it cool.</p>


<h3>SUGARED LEMONS, No. 1.</h3>

<p>458. These may be prepared in the same manner
as the sugared oranges (see above,) only they
should have a tea spoonful and a half of sugar to
each slice; as they are more firm than oranges,
they require to stand longer to become perfectly
impregnated with the sugar.</p>

<p>They are better to stand about an hour before
they are to be eaten. The white skin should be
carefully peeled off, as it imparts an unpleasant
bitter flavor when permitted to remain long in the
sugar. These are very grateful to the sick and
feverish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>


<h3>SUGARED LEMONS, No. 2.</h3>

<p>459. Select fine large lemons. Peel off the
outer skin and as much as possible of the white
skin. Cut them in slices latitudinally or <em>round</em> the
lemon, about the eight of an inch thick. Sprinkle
them with white powdered sugar, a tea spoonful of
sugar to each slice. Let them stand three hours,
then strain off as much of the juice as possible from
the lemons, put it in a sauce-pan over a slow fire,
and as soon as the juice begins to simmer throw in
the slices of lemon. Let them cook five minutes,
take them out and pour the syrup over them.
Should the lemons not prove sufficiently juicy to
melt the sugar entirely, a little water may be
added.</p>

Half a pint of water,<br />
One egg,<br />
Sugar and nutmeg to the taste.<br />

One egg,<br />
Sugar and nutmeg to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the cider. Have the egg well beaten,
pour it into the cider, then have ready two vessels
and pour the whole quickly from one vessel into
the other several times. Add the sugar and nutmeg.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE SOUP.</h3>

<p>
462. Two potatoes,<br />
Two onions,<br />
Two turnips,<br />
One carrot,<br />
A little parsley chopped fine,<br />
Salt to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Cut the potatoes in quarters, slice the onions, cut
the turnips in quarters, slice the carrots. Put all
in a stew-pan with three pints of water, and salt to
the taste. Boil it down to one quart. About fifteen

One pint of water,<br />
Lemon juice and sugar to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the moss in water until it forms a jelly, and
add the lemon-juice and sugar. Vanilla may be
substituted for lemon-juice, but the latter is more
palatable. Strain it.</p>


<h3>ARROW ROOT.</h3>

<p>
464. One table spoonful of ground arrow-root,<br />
One pint of water.<br />
</p>

<p>Mix the arrow-root with a little water, to the
consistence of a paste. Have ready a pint of boiling

<p>466. Squeeze the juice out of a fine lemon,
pour over it as much boiling water as will make it
palatable, and add sugar to the taste. Stand it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
away to cool; when cold it will be found quite as
good as that made with cold water, and is generally
preferred by physicians, as the boiling water destroys
the unhealthy qualities of the lemon.</p>


<h3>OAT-MEAL GRUEL.</h3>

<p>467. Mix one table spoonful of oat-meal to a
smooth paste with a little cold water. Pour this
into one pint of boiling water; let it boil for half

<p>Children become very fond of this.</p>


<h3>PAP OF GRATED FLOUR.</h3>

<p>471. Take a quarter of a pound of flour and
pour on just enough water to moisten it. Form it
into a ball and tie it in a cloth, closely and firmly.
Put it in a vessel of boiling water and let it boil
the whole day. Then take it out, dip it in a pan
of cold water, remove the cloth, and place it in a
cool oven to dry, when it will be fit for use.</p>

<p>To make the pap, grate some of this, mix it to
a paste with cold milk, and stir it into some boiling
milk; boil it slowly ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Let them boil slowly until they are tender, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
not broken to pieces, then dish them, and if not
quite salt enough, a little may be sprinkled over
them. Care should be taken to season the meat
for an invalid with very little salt, as it is frequently
very unpalatable during convalescence.</p>

<p>After the sweet-breads have been cooked as
above described, they may be taken from the water
and drained; then heat the gridiron, grease the
bars, to prevent the sweet-breads from sticking, and
broil them quickly over some hot coals. They
should be of a very delicate brown when done.</p>


<h3>PANADA, No. 1.</h3>

<p>473. Mix two tea spoonsful of grated cracker,
with a little cold water, and stir it into half a pint
of boiling water. Let it boil a few minutes till it

<p>Beat the eggs very light and thick, add the milk
sugar and brandy.</p>


<h3>MINCED MEAT.</h3>

<p>
515. Five pounds of beef or tongue,<br />
Two pounds of suet,<br />
Seven pounds of sugar,<br />
Seven pounds of apples,<br />
Three pounds of raisins,<br />
Three pounds of currants,<br />
Three nutmegs,<br />
Two ounces of cinnamon,<br />
A dessert spoonful of ground allspice,<br />
One small tea spoonful of ground mace,<br />
The juice of two lemons and the grated rind of one,<br />
Moisten it with equal portions of wine and cider,<br />
Brandy to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the meat in water which has been salted in
the proportion of one tea spoonful of salt to every
quart of water. When it is tender stand it away
to get perfectly cold before it is chopped. Wash,
pick and dry your currants, prepare the spices, and
seed the raisins. Pare and core the apples, chop
them fine, chop the meat very fine, add the fruit,
sugar and spice, lemon-juice, and grated lemon
rind, (also the brandy and wine.) Mix the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
thoroughly; it will be fit for use on the following
day. If you wish to keep your minced meat for
several weeks, chop the meat and add the currants,
raisins, sugar and spice, but leave out the apples,
lemon, wine and cider; mix the other ingredients
and merely moisten it with brandy; pack the mixture
tightly in a stone jar and cover it close.</p>

<p>When you wish to make it into pies, take out
some of the meat, chop your apples, and mix with
it in the proportions given above. Moisten with
cider, and add wine and brandy to your taste.</p>


<h3>SANDWICHES.</h3>

<p>516. These are generally made of cold boiled
ham or tongue. Slice your ham or tongue as thin
as possible. Then butter your bread on the loaf,
and with a very sharp knife cut it in <em>very thin</em>
slices. Roll in each slice of bread a slice of the
ham or tongue. A cold fried oyster is very nice
in each sandwich.</p>


<h3>WINE SANGAREE.</h3>

<p>517. Mix equal portions of wine and water,
sweeten it to your taste, and grate nutmeg over the
top.</p>

<p>Ale or porter sangaree is made in the same
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>


<h3>POACHED EGGS.</h3>

<p>518. Have a broad shallow vessel of boiling
water. Break your eggs in a plate, and be careful
not to break the yelks. Take the water from
the fire, slide the eggs carefully into it one at a
time, and then put them over the fire again.
Whilst they are boiling throw the water over the
yelks with a spoon, and as soon as the whites are
thick take them out with an egg slice. Trim them
neatly and send them to the table hot.</p>


<h3>PLAIN OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>519. Beat four eggs very light. Have ready
a pan of hot butter, pour the beaten eggs into it,
and fry it till it is of a fine brown on the under
side, then lap one half over the other, and serve it
hot. Just before you lap it, sprinkle a little salt
and pepper over the top.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley or onion may be mixed with
the egg before it is fried.</p>


<h3>HAM OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>520. Whisk four eggs very light, and add to it
as much grated ham as will flavor it. Fry it in
hot butter till it is brown on the lower side. Sprinkle
salt and pepper over it, and fold one half over
the other. The salt should not be put in the egg,
as it thins it.</p>

<p>Garnish the dish with green parsley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>


<h3>BREAD OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>
521. One gill of bread crumbs,<br />
Eight eggs,<br />
A gill and a half of cream,<br />
Pepper and salt to the taste.<br />
</p>

<p>Warm the cream and pour it over a gill of baker's
bread crumbs; when the bread is perfectly
soft mash it well with the cream, and add pepper
and salt to the taste. Beat the eggs and stir them
into the bread and cream. Have a pan of hot butter,
pour the mixture in and fry it. Do not turn
it as that will make it heavy. The top may be
browned with a salamander, or the pan of the
shovel heated very hot and held near it will brown
it. It may be folded one half over the other; in
that case it need not be browned with a salamander.</p>


<h3>TOMATO OMELETTE.</h3>

<p>
522. Six eggs,<br />
A wine-glass of flour,<br />
Four ripe tomatoes,<br />
Pepper and salt to the taste,<br />
Milk sufficient to mix the flour smoothly.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the eggs very light, stir in the mixed milk
and flour, peel and chop the tomatoes and add
with the pepper and salt. Have a pan with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
hot butter, pour in the mixture and fry it. When
done it may be lapped half over or not, according
to the fancy. Do not turn it.</p>


<h3>BROWNED FLOUR.</h3>

<p>523. This is very useful to thicken gravy and
give it a brown color.</p>

<p>Put your flour into a pan, and set it over a moderate
fire, stir it all the time till it is brown, but do
not let it scorch, as it will communicate an unpleasant
taste to your gravy.</p>

<p>When it is cool put it in a jar for future use.</p>


<h3>DRIED CHERRIES, FOR PIES.</h3>

<p>524. Pick your cherries, and wash them thoroughly
through several waters to remove all the
grit. Put them into a stone jar with half a pound
of sugar to a pound of cherries, and warm water
enough to cover them. Place your jar in a vessel
of water and set it where it will keep hot. Let
them stand for twelve hours. If the water should
soak into the cherries and leave them too dry, add
a little more. When they are fully swollen and
perfectly soft they are fit for use. If they are not
sweet enough add more sugar.</p>

<p>Dried fruits are more tender and juicy cooked in
this manner than when they are boiled or stewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>


<h3>DRIED APPLES, FOR PIES.</h3>

<p>525. Pick and wash them well. Then pour
over boiling water enough to cover them. Let
them stand all night to soak. In the morning put
the apples with the water they were soaked in into
your stew-pan, if they have absorbed all the water
and are nearly dry, add a little more, simmer them
slowly, but do not let them boil. When perfectly
soft, pass them through a sieve, and prepare them
for pies according to the directions given for apples
which have not been dried.</p>


<h3>DRIED PEACHES, FOR PIES.</h3>

<p>526. These are cooked in the same manner as
dried apples (see above,) only they are flavored
with a piece of lemon or orange-peel stewed with
them.</p>

<p>When they are done, take out the peel and mash
them, add sugar to the taste. They require no
butter.</p>


<h3>DRIED PUMPKIN, FOR PIES.</h3>

<p>527. Cut a pumpkin in half lengthwise, take
out the seeds, pare off the rind, and cut it in slices
about an inch thick. String it on fine twine and
hang it in a dry place.</p>

<p>In the winter stew and use it as green pumpkin.
The cheese-shaped pumpkin is the best kind for
drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>


<h3>TO PREPARE SALÆRATUS.</h3>

<p>528. Put the salæratus in a vessel, add enough
cold water to dissolve it, then pour off the liquid
into a bottle and cork it. Be careful to pour it off
gently as a great deal of sediment settles at the
bottom of the vessel in which it is dissolved.</p>

<p>Carbonate of ammonia is much nicer than salæratus;
it is prepared in the same manner; be careful
to keep the bottle corked, and keep it in a cool
place.</p>

<p>It may be used in all the receipts where salæratus
is directed; but only half the quantity is necessary&mdash;thus:
if one table spoonful of the salæratus
is required, half a table spoonful of ammonia will
be sufficient.</p>


<h3>LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>
529. One quart of lemon-juice,<br />
Nine quarts of water,<br />
Eight pounds of white sugar.<br />
</p>

<p>Mix the lemon-juice and sugar, and stand it
away. Just before the lemonade is served, add the
water which should be iced.</p>


<h3>PUNCH.</h3>

<p>
530. Four pounds of sugar,<br />
One pint of lemon-juice,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>One pint of Jamaica spirits,<br />
Half a pint of peach brandy,<br />
Half a pint of French brandy,<br />
Five quarts of water.<br />
</p>

<p>The quantity of liquor may be regulated according
to the taste.</p>


<h3>MACARONI.</h3>

<p>
531. A quarter of a pound of macaroni,<br />
One tea spoonful of butter,<br />
One gill of milk or cream,<br />
One table spoonful of grated cheese.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the macaroni in water that has been salted
in the proportion of a tea spoonful of salt to a quart
of water. When it is tender take it out of the
water and place it on a sieve, or in a colander, to
drain. Boil a gill of milk or cream, and add to it
a tea spoonful of butter rolled in flour, let it boil
half a minute. Put your macaroni, after it is well
drained, into a stew-pan, pour this boiled cream
over it, and add to it the grated cheese. Let it get
very hot, but do not let it boil, and serve it.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_532" id="Article_532">INDIAN MUSH.</a></h3>

<p>
532. Two quarts of water,<br />
Two tea spoonsful of salt,<br />
As much Indian meal as will make a thick batter.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Have a pot with two quarts of boiling water,
add the salt as above, and stir in <em>very gradually</em>
as much Indian meal as will form a thick batter.
Let it boil half an hour, and beat it hard all the
time it is cooking, which will make it light when
done.</p>

<p>This is generally eaten with new milk, or sometimes
with molasses and butter.</p>


<h3>FRIED MUSH.</h3>

<p>533. The mush is prepared as in the above receipt.
Let it get cold, cut it in slices, flour them
on both sides, and fry them of a light brown.</p>


<h3>WELSH RABBIT.</h3>

<p>534. Cut some old rich cheese in very thin
pieces, add to it a spoonful of cream. Put it over
a slow fire and let it stand until the cheese is entirely
dissolved.</p>

<p>Serve it with toast. Some like pepper and mustard.</p>


<h3>MINT JULEP.</h3>

<p>535. Take young mint, pick off the leaves,
wash them, and to one tumbler of leaves add one
tumbler of brandy and Jamaica spirits mixed. Pour
the liquor on the mint to extract the flavor, then
strain it off on a tumbler of sugar; when the sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
is dissolved, add a tumbler of ice finely pounded.
Stir all well together.</p>


<h3>MILK PUNCH.</h3>

<p>536. Sweeten a half pint of rich milk to the
taste. Add to this half a table spoonful of fourth
proof brandy.</p>


<h3>COTTAGE CHEESE.</h3>

<p>537. Put some sour milk in a warm place until
the whey begins to separate from the curd, but by
no means let it get hard. Pour the curd into a
three cornered bag in the shape of a pudding bag,
hang it up and let it drain until no more water will
drip from it. Then turn it out into a pan, mash
the curd very fine and smooth with a wooden
spoon; add as much good rich cream, as will make
it about as thick as batter. Salt it to your taste.
Sprinkle pepper over the top if you choose.</p>


<h3>TO PREPARE RENNET.</h3>

<p>538. Get a dried rennet in market, wash it in
lukewarm water, but do not scrape it. Cut it up
in small pieces, put them in a bottle, and pour over
them a quart of Lisbon wine. After this has stood
for a week a table spoonful of the wine will turn a
quart of milk. Or if the use of wine is objectionable,
the rennet may be preserved by hanging it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
cool dry place. And then every time you wish to
use it, cut off a piece, wash it, and soak it in warm
water; the water it is soaked in will turn the milk.</p>


<h3>TO CURE HAMS.</h3>

<p>539. The following is the Newbold receipt for
curing hams.</p>

<p>
Seven pounds of coarse salt,<br />
Five pounds of brown sugar,<br />
Half an ounce of pearl-ash, two ounces of saltpetre,<br />
Four gallons of water.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the above ingredients together, and skim
the pickle when cold. Pour it over your hams,
and let them remain in it eight weeks.</p>

<p>The above proportions are for one hundred
pounds of meat.</p>


<h3>TO PREPARE APPLES FOR PIES.</h3>

<p>540. Pare and core your apples, cut them in
slices, and throw them into cold water. Then take
them out of the water, put them into a stew-pan;
if the apples are tender, the water which adheres
to them will be sufficient to cook them; if not, a
little more may be added. Cover the stew-pan, and
place them near the fire. Let them stew till they
are soft and burst; then mash them, and add half
an ounce of butter to each pint of the stewed ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ple.
When they get nearly cold, add sugar, rose-water,
and nutmeg to the taste.</p>


<h3>TO CURE DRIED BEEF.</h3>

<p>
541. For one hundred pounds of beef:<br />
Seven pounds of coarse salt,<br />
Five pounds of brown sugar,<br />
Half an ounce of pearl-ash, two ounces of saltpetre. Four gallons of water.<br />
</p>

<p>Boil the sugar, salt, pearl-ash, saltpetre and
water together, skim it and pour it over the meat
when it is cold. At the end of three weeks take out
your beef. This is the celebrated Newbold receipt.</p>


<h3>TO CURE BEEF AND HAMS.</h3>

<p>
542. Half a bushel of fine salt,<br />
Half a pound of saltpetre,<br />
Half a gallon of molasses.<br />
</p>

<p>Mix the salt, saltpetre, and molasses together
well with your hands, until the mixture resembles
brown sugar.</p>

<p>Rub the meat well with this mixture, then place
it in your tubs, with the fleshy side up; it should
have a coating of the salt, &amp;c., at least half an
inch thick. At the end of ten days, or two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
at farthest, take out your beef, and hang it in a
dry place. Hams should remain in the salt from
five to six weeks.</p>

<p>Never smoke beef. Hams would be better if
not smoked.</p>


<h3>TO CURE SHAD.</h3>

<p>543. Clean the shad nicely, place them in layers
with back down, and laid open so as the inside
of the fish may be up. Sprinkle each fish plentifully
with ground salt, and let them stand twenty-four
hours. This draws out all the blood. Wipe
them all dry with clean napkins.</p>

<p>Place them in layers in a clean tub, with the
backs down as before. For one hundred shad take
half a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of brown
sugar. Strew plenty of rock salt over them with
the saltpetre and sugar, there is no danger of
putting on too much salt as they will only absorb a
certain quantity.</p>


<h3>TO ROAST COFFEE.</h3>

<p>544. Pick the black or imperfect grains from
the coffee. Put it in a pan, and stir it all the time
it is roasting; when done it should be the color of
the hull of a ripe chestnut. It should be brown
all through, but not black. About ten minutes
before it is done add to two pounds of coffee half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
an ounce of butter. Whilst hot put it in a box
and cover it closely.</p>


<h3>COFFEE.</h3>

<p>545. Beat an egg; and to one tea cupful of
ground coffee add one-third of the beaten egg, and
as much cold water as will just moisten the coffee;
do not put in much cold water, stir all well together,
put the mixture in your coffee pot, and
pour over it six tea cupsful of <em>boiling</em> water. Let
it boil hard for ten or fifteen minutes. When it
begins to boil stir it frequently, and never leave it
until the grounds sink, which they will do in a few
minutes after it has been on the fire. Be careful
and do not let your coffee boil over, as by that
means you lose a great deal of the grounds and
consequently the coffee will be weakened.</p>

<p>Rinse your pot, if it be silver or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'britania'">Britannia</ins> metal,
with <em>boiling water</em>, pour the coffee into it, and
serve it hot. Coffee and tea lose much of their
flavor if served cold.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE.</h3>

<p>546. Shave down three ounces of chocolate,
over this pour enough hot water to dissolve it;
mix it to a smooth paste, put it in a pipkin, and
add one quart of boiling water. Place it on the
fire, stir it occasionally, and let it boil fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
minutes, then add one tea cupful of rich milk or
cream. Let it boil a minute or two longer, pour
it off, and send it to the table. Chocolate retains
its heat longer than either tea or coffee.</p>

<p>Never boil chocolate in your coffee pot as it
would be likely to impart to the coffee an unpleasant
flavor.</p>


<h3>TEA.</h3>

<p>547. Scald your tea pot with boiling water, and
allow a tea spoonful of tea for each person and one
over. Pour enough boiling water on the tea leaves
to rather more than wet them. Let it stand fifteen
minutes; pour on as much boiling water as will
serve one cup to each one of the company. As
soon as the first cups are poured out, add half a
tea spoonful for each person, and pour on some
boiling water. The most convenient article for
hot water is an urn with an iron heater inside which
keeps it boiling on the table. But water may be
kept sufficiently hot in an ordinary tea pot.</p>

<p>Some who are particular about their tea, stop
the spout of the tea pot with a cork, while the tea
is drawing, to retain the aroma.</p>

<p>Tea and coffee pots should always be set away
with the lids off.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE YEAST.</h3>

<p>548. Boil a tea cupful of hops in one quart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
water till reduced to one half. Strain it through
a sieve, and add one wine glassful of salt. Return
the hot water into the vessel it was boiled in. Mix
some flour with cold water, and stir in so as to
make it about the consistency of thick molasses.
Let it boil a few minutes, then take it off the fire,
and set it away to cool; when lukewarm, add some
yeast, and when it rises put it into a stone jar;
which should not be filled, cover it, and the following
day it will be fit for use.</p>

<p>As the yeast is so well salted there is no necessity
to put salt in the bread.</p>

<p>You should always have a vessel on purpose to
boil hops.</p>


<h3>POTATO YEAST.</h3>

<p>549. Boil some potatoes, mash them, and to
six potatoes add one gill of flour. Stir in as much
water as will make the whole into a thick batter;
add some yeast and a wine glassful of salt. When
it is light, put it in your jar and cover it.</p>


<h3><a name="Article_550" id="Article_550">BREAD.</a></h3>

<p>550. Set a sponge at night of a pound of flour,
a little salt, if your yeast should not be salt enough,
a gill of yeast, and water enough to make a thick
batter. In the morning stir in as much flour as
will form a dough, knead it well, and if the weather
is cold set it in a warm place to rise. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
it is light grease your pans, mould out the dough
in loaves, put them in the pans, and as soon as they
rise again bake them.</p>

<p>If the weather is cold, set your sponge with
lukewarm water, place it near the fire to rise. But
in summer it should be set with cold water, and
not be placed near the fire. It is better in warm
weather to put the dough in your pans as soon as
the flour is added to the sponge and the dough
well kneaded, as if permitted to stand it might
turn sour.</p>

<p>Bread is much nicer baked in small loaves.</p>


<h3>POTATO BREAD.</h3>

<p>551. Boil some potatoes, mash them fine, and
add as much warm water as will make a mixture
about as thick as cream. Pass it through a sieve
in order to extract all the lumps. When cool add
a little salt, some yeast, and as much flour as will
make a very thick batter.</p>

<p>The next morning stir in enough flour to make
a dough. Knead it well, let it rise, when light
grease your pans, mould it out gently into loaves,
put them in the pans, let them stand till they
rise again, then bake them.</p>

<p>This bread may be made with milk instead of
water, but it is best when eaten fresh, as it soon
becomes dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>


<h3>MUSH BREAD.</h3>

<p>552. Make some thin Indian mush, (see <a href="#Article_532">No.
532</a>,) when cool add a little salt and flour enough
to make a thick batter, stir in some yeast.</p>

<p>Let it stand all night to rise, in the morning add
flour enough to form a dough. Knead it well, set
it to rise; when light mould it out in loaves,
grease your pans, and when it gets light again
bake it.</p>


<h3>RYE BREAD.</h3>

<p>553. This is made in the same manner as wheat,
(No. <a href="#Article_550">550</a>,) only it must have more rye flour to
make a stiffer dough, and requires more kneading.
It takes rather longer to bake than wheat bread.</p>


<h3>DYSPEPTIC BREAD.</h3>
<p>554. This bread is made of unbolted flour instead
of that in general use.</p>

<p>It is made in the same manner as bread, (<a href="#Article_550">No.
550</a>,) knead it very well and be careful to have it
thoroughly baked.</p>

<p>Toast made of this bread is very good.</p>


<h3>FRIED BREAD.</h3>

<p>555. Slice some bread, stale is better than
fresh; pour over it enough rich milk or cream, if
you have it, to moisten it. Beat an egg, dip each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
slice of the bread in the egg, and fry them brown
on both sides. Season the bread with pepper and
salt to your taste.</p>


<h3>COMMON MUSTARD.</h3>

<p>
556. One table spoonful of ground mustard,<br />
One tea spoonful of sugar,<br />
One salt spoonful of salt.<br />
</p>

<p>Mix the salt, sugar, and mustard together, and
then pour on some boiling water gradually, stir it
with a horn spoon or knife till it is quite smooth.
Some like it quite thick, others prefer it so thin as
to run on the plate.</p>


<h3>ICING FOR CAKES.</h3>

<p>557. Beat the whites of two eggs till they are
very dry, then add gradually ten ounces of pulverized
white sugar. Dredge flour over the top of
the cake and wipe it off, to make the icing adhere.
Put it over with a broad bladed knife; it should be
put on quite thick. When this coating is dry, dilute
the remainder of the icing on your dish with a
little rose-water, and put another coating over the
top, which will have a glossy appearance.</p>


<h3>TO DRY HERBS.</h3>

<p>558. They should be picked just before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
plant blossoms, wash them to free them from the
dust, place them on a sieve to drain. Then put
them in the oven after the bread has been drawn
out, and let them remain in it till they are perfectly
dry. Rub them from the stalks, put them in glass
jars and cover them closely.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>559. Take ripe raspberries, put them in a pan,
and mash them with a large wooden spoon or
masher. Strain the juice through a jelly bag, and
to each pint of juice add one pound of loaf sugar
and one quart of vinegar. When the sugar has
dissolved place the whole over the fire in a preserving
kettle, and let it boil a minute or two and
skim it. When cold bottle it, cork it well, and it
will be fit for use.</p>


<h3>CELERY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>560. Put half a pint of celery seed into a quart
of vinegar; bottle it, and in a month it will be fit
for use. It must be strained before it is put in the
castor bottle.</p>


<h3>PEPPER VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>561. Put the coral peppers in a bottle, and pour
over vinegar enough to cover them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>


<h3>MOLASSES CANDY.</h3>

<p>
562. One quart of West India molasses,<br />
Half a pound of brown sugar,<br />
The juice of one lemon.<br />
</p>

<p>Put the molasses in a kettle with the sugar, boil
it over a slow, steady fire till it is done, which you
can easily tell by dropping a little in cold water,
if done it will be crisp, if not, it will be stringy.
A good way to judge if it is boiled enough is to let
it boil till it stops bubbling. Stir it very frequently,
and just before it is taken off the fire add the lemon-juice.
Butter a shallow tin pan, and pour it in to
get cold.</p>

<p>Molasses candy may be flavored with any thing
you choose. Some flavor with lemon, and add
roasted ground-nuts, or almonds blanched.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY PIE.</h3>

<p>563. Pick off the stems and blossoms of your
gooseberries, wash them, and pour enough boiling
water over to cover them. Let them stand a few
minutes and then drain them. Line your pie-plates
with paste, fill them with the fruit, and add three-quarters
of a pound of sugar to a pint of fruit.
Dredge a little flour over the top and cover with a
lid of paste, leave an opening in the centre to permit
the steam to escape, and bake them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>


<h3>RIPE CURRANT PIE.</h3>

<p>564. Stem your currants and wash them. Line
your pie-plates with paste, fill them with the fruit,
and add sugar in the proportion of a half a pound
to one pint of currants. Dredge some flour over
the top, put on the lid of the pie, leave an opening
in the centre and bake it.</p>


<h3>GREEN CURRANT PIE.</h3>

<p>565. The fruit should have attained its full
size before it is picked. Stem the currants and
wash them; then pour enough boiling water over
them to cover them, and let them stand while you
prepare the paste. Line the bottom of your pie-plates
with paste, drain your fruit through the colander
and fill your plates, adding half a pound of
sugar to a pint of currants, or in that proportion.
Dredge a little flour over the fruit, and put on the
top crust; leave an opening in the centre to permit
the steam to escape. The pie requires no water,
as a sufficient quantity will adhere to the fruit.</p>


<h3>APPLE BUTTER.</h3>

<p>566. Boil one barrel of cider till reduced to one
half the original quantity. Pare, core, and slice
enough apples to measure two bushels and a half
when cut up. Put them in with the cider, let them
boil, and stir it all the time it is boiling. The ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>ples
must be reduced to a pulp, which will take
from nine to twelve hours. It should be boiled till
perfectly smooth and thick. Great care should be
taken not to let it scorch, as it would be entirely
spoiled.</p>

<p>New cider is the kind used for making apple
butter.</p>


<h3>JELLY CAKE, No. 1.</h3>

<p>
567. Ten eggs,<br />
One pound of sugar,<br />
Three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour,<br />
The grated rind of two, and juice of one lemon.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the yelks of the eggs very light and add
the sugar. Stir the yelks and sugar very hard
until they are smooth and light. Add to this the
grated rind and lemon-juice, and beat it, for a few
minutes longer. Whisk the whites to a dry froth,
and stir them in very gently. Do not beat it after
the whites are in. Butter some shallow tin-plates
and put in three table spoonsful of the mixture.
Bake them in a quick oven. Or you may heat a
griddle or bake-iron, grease it well with butter;
grease a tin cake-ring, place the ring on the griddle,
pour in three table spoonsful of the mixture,
put the griddle in a hot oven, and bake it without
turning it. When done take it off, grease the grid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>dle
and ring again, and proceed as before. When
the cakes are cool place one on a plate, cover the
top of it with any kind of <em>thick</em> jelly, put another
cake on the top of this, cover it with a layer of
jelly, and so on. Place the cakes evenly over
each other. It is customary to ice the top one,
though it looks very nice with white sugar sifted
over.</p>

<p>These are better to be eaten fresh.</p>


<h3>JELLY CAKE, No. 2.</h3>

<p>
568. One pound of flour,<br />
One pound of sugar,<br />
Three-quarters of a pound of butter,<br />
Ten eggs,<br />
One gill of rose-water,<br />
One tea spoonful of grated nutmeg,<br />
Half a tea spoonful of ground cinnamon.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, whisk the
eggs very light and add to it; stir in the spices and
rose-water, then the flour. Beat the mixture very
hard for ten minutes. Heat your griddle or bake-iron,
grease it well with butter, grease a cake-ring
and place on the griddle. Pour into the ring three
table spoonsful of the mixture, place the griddle in
a hot oven and bake it quickly. These cakes are
never turned; the oven should be hot enough to
bake the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>When one is done take it out, place it on a clean
napkin to cool, and grease the griddle and ring
and proceed as before. When they are all cold
spread the top of each one with thick jelly, and
place them neatly one over the other. The top
cake should have no jelly on it. It may be iced,
or have white sugar sifted over it.</p>


<h3>HONEY CAKE, No. 1.</h3>

<p>
569. Three-quarters of a pound of butter,<br />
Three-quarters of a pound of sugar,<br />
Six eggs,<br />
Two pounds of flour,<br />
One table spoonful of ground cinnamon,<br />
Half a gill of cream,<br />
One quart of honey,<br />
One table spoonful of <em>dissolved</em> salæratus.<br />
</p>


<p>Beat the butter and sugar to a cream; beat the
eggs and stir in with the flour, cinnamon, cream
and honey. Beat the whole for ten minutes, then
stir in the salæratus. Line your pan with several
thicknesses of paper, well buttered; pour in the
mixture and bake it in a slow oven.</p>


<h3>HONEY CAKE, No. 2.</h3>

<p>
570. Half a pound of sugar,<br />
Half a pound of butter,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>One pint of honey,<br />
One table spoonful of cinnamon,<br />
One tea spoonful of nutmeg,<br />
As much flour as will form a dough.<br />
</p>

<p>Stir the butter and sugar together, add the nutmeg,
cinnamon, honey, and enough flour to form a
dough. Knead it well, roll it out in sheets, cut it
in cakes with a cake-cutter or the rim of a tumbler,
place them on tins and bake them in a moderately
hot oven. Before you set them in the oven wash
them over with a little honey and water, mixed in
equal quantities.</p>


<h3>CITRON CAKE.</h3>

<p>
571. One pound of butter,<br />
One pound of sugar,<br />
One pound of flour,<br />
One pound of citron,<br />
Ten eggs,<br />
Half a gill of brandy,<br />
One tea spoonful of grated nutmeg,<br />
One tea spoonful of cinnamon.<br />
</p>

<p>Grate the nutmeg, slice the citron in very thin
narrow strips about half an inch long, and flour it.
Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, whisk the
eggs very light, and stir them in with the flour,
brandy, and spices. Beat the whole for several
minutes; then stir in the citron. Line your pans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
with several thicknesses of paper, well buttered,
pour in the mixture and bake them in a slow oven.
When cold ice them.</p>


<h3>VANILLA KISSES.</h3>

<p>
572. Half a pound of pulverized white sugar,<br />
The whites of six eggs,<br />
One vanilla bean.<br />
</p>

<p>Pound the bean in a mortar until it is completely
pulverized. Whisk the eggs to a stiff froth, add
the sugar very gradually, then stir in the vanilla.
Drop the mixture on white paper so as not to touch
each other. You may make them any size you
choose. About a dessert spoonful makes a pretty
sized cake. Take care to have them sufficiently
far apart. Place them on tins with several thicknesses
of stout paper under them, set them in a hot
oven, and as soon as they have a tinge of brown
take them out, with a broad bladed knife slip them
off the paper, and place the under sides of two together.</p>


<h3>VANILLA CAKE.</h3>

<p>
573. Half a pound of pulverized white sugar,<br />
The whites of four eggs,<br />
One small vanilla bean, or half of a large one.<br />
</p>

<p>Pound the vanilla bean in a mortar until it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
completely pulverized. Beat the eggs to a dry
froth, add the sugar very gradually; when all the
sugar is in stir in the vanilla. Drop a tea spoonful
of the mixture on thick white paper to form
each cake, they must not be near enough to touch
each other. Place them in a cool oven, and as
soon as they are sufficiently dry take them out, as
soon as they are cold slip the blade of a case-knife
under each one to loosen it from the paper. The
oven should not be hot enough to brown them.</p>


<h3>GINGER POUND CAKE.</h3>

<p>
574. Three-quarters of a pound of butter,<br />
Three-quarters of a pound of sugar,<br />
Six eggs,<br />
One pound and a half of flour,<br />
One pint of molasses,<br />
The grated rind of two large oranges,<br />
Three table spoonsful of ginger,<br />
Two table spoonsful of cinnamon,<br />
One table spoonful of <em>dissolved</em> salæratus, or<br />
One large tea spoonful of dissolved carbonate of ammonia.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the
eggs very light and add to it, then stir in all the
other ingredients except the salæratus or ammonia.
Beat the mixture very hard for several minutes,
then stir in the salæratus or ammonia. Butter an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
earthen cake mould or thick iron pan, pour in the
mixture and bake it in a moderate oven. If you
bake it in an iron pan line the pan with several
thicknesses of stout paper well buttered.</p>


<h3>CURRANT BISCUITS.</h3>

<p>
575. One pound of sugar,<br />
One pound of butter,<br />
One pound and a half of flour,<br />
Four eggs,<br />
One tea spoonful of cinnamon,<br />
One tea spoonful of nutmeg,<br />
One pound of currants.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar together; whisk the
eggs, and add to it with the other ingredients.
Roll the dough out in sheets, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cut it it into'">cut it into</ins> cakes,
place them on tins, sift white sugar over the top,
and bake them in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>The currants must first be picked, washed and
dried, before they are put in the cakes.</p>


<h3>PLAIN CRULLERS.</h3>

<p>
576. Three-quarters of a pound of pulverized white sugar,<br />
Eight eggs,<br />
As much flour as will make a soft dough,<br />
One dessert spoonful of <em>dissolved</em> salæratus,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>One tea spoonful of nutmeg,<br />
One tea spoonful of cinnamon,<br />
The grated rind of one lemon, or<br />
Six drops of essence of lemon.<br />
</p>

<p>Whisk the eggs very light, stir in the sugar, and
about half the flour, spices and lemon; then add
the salæratus, and as much more flour as will make
a soft dough. Do not knead it, but roll it with
your hands in round strips, cut them about three
inches long, double and twist them. Throw them
into boiling lard to cook them. They require to
be turned over whilst they are boiling in the lard,
in order to have them brown on both sides. These
cakes are very much liked and are very easily
made. Sift sugar over before they are sent to the
table.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE BUTTER.</h3>

<p>577. Strain your milk and stand it in a spring-house
or cellar, which should be about 54° of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Farenheit'">Fahrenheit</ins>.
The spring-house should be well ventilated.
Let the milk stand about three days, then
skim off the cream with a skimmer made for the
purpose, and take care to get as little of the sour
milk with it as possible. Then churn it; and after
churning, wash your butter thoroughly in clear
fresh water, which should be as cold as you can
get it. Then salt it and work it well, to get out
all the remaining buttermilk. It should be dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and solid when you have finished working it this
time. After your butter has been salted and
worked <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thorougly'">thoroughly</ins>, let it stand about five or six
hours, or until every particle of salt is entirely
dissolved; then work it again in order to mix the
salt more completely through the whole mass, but
do not touch it with your hands as it will make it
greasy, and spoil both its appearance and taste.
Make it into pounds or small prints, and it will be
ready for use.</p>

<p>When more than one churning is done at a time,
each churning should be worked separately, or it
will be apt to be streaked; as, if the temperature
of the cream is higher in one churning than in the
other, the butter will not mix without appearing
clouded.</p>

<p>The above receipt was obtained from one of the
best butter-makers in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania,
and may be confidently relied on for its
accuracy.</p>


<h3>QUEEN CAKE.</h3>

<p>
578. One pound of butter,<br />
One pound of sugar,<br />
Fourteen ounces of flour,<br />
Ten eggs,<br />
One tea spoonful of cinnamon,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>One tea spoonful of nutmeg,<br />
One large table spoonful of brandy,<br />
One table spoonful of rose water.<br />
</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, whisk the
eggs well, and stir the whole together, add gradually
the liquor, spices and flour. Beat the mixture
for several minutes, butter some small round tin
pans, fill them about three parts full and bake
them.</p>

<p>Queen cakes are very nice with a few dried currants
in them. To the above quantity one pound
and a half of dried currants would be sufficient.</p>
